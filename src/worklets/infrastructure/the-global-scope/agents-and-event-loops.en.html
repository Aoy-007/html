  <h5 id="worklet-agents-and-event-loops">Agents and event loops</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Each <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code> is contained in its own <span>worklet agent</span>, which
  has its corresponding <span data-x="concept-agent-event-loop">event loop</span>. However, in
  practice, implementation of these agents and event loops is expected to be different from most
  others.</p>

  <p>A <span>worklet agent</span> exists for each <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code> since, in theory,
  an implementation could use a separate thread for each <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code> instance,
  and allowing this level of parallelism is best done using agents. However, because their
  [[CanBlock]] value is false, there is no requirement that agents and threads are one-to-one. This
  allows implementations the freedom to execute scripts loaded into a worklet on any thread,
  including one running code from other agents with [[CanBlock]] of false, such as the thread of a
  <span>similar-origin window agent</span> ("the main thread"). Contrast this with <span
  data-x="dedicated worker agent">dedicated worker agents</span>, whose true value for [[CanBlock]]
  effectively requires them to get a dedicated operating system thread.</p>

  <p>Worklet <span data-x="event loop">event loops</span> are also somewhat special. They are only
  used for <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> associated with <code
  data-x="dom-Worklet-addModule">addModule()</code>, tasks wherein the user agent invokes
  author-defined methods, and <span data-x="microtask">microtasks</span>. Thus, even though the <a
  href="#event-loop-processing-model">event loop processing model</a> specifies that all event loops
  run continuously, implementations can achieve observably-equivalent results using a simpler
  strategy, which just <span data-x="es-invoking-callback-functions">invokes</span> author-provided
  methods and then relies on that process to <span>perform a microtask checkpoint</span>.</p>
