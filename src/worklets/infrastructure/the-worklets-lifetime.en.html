  <h4 id="worklets-lifetime">The worklet's lifetime</h4>

  <p>The lifetime of a <code>Worklet</code> has no special considerations; it is tied to the object
  it belongs to, such as the <code>Window</code>.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Each <code>Document</code> has a <dfn data-x="concept-Document-worklet-global-scopes">worklet
  global scopes</dfn>, which is a <span>set</span> of <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code>s, initially
  empty.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The lifetime of a <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code> is, at a minimum, tied to the
  <code>Document</code> whose <span data-x="concept-Document-worklet-global-scopes">worklet global
  scopes</span> contain it. In particular, <span data-x="discard a document">discarding</span> the
  <code>Document</code> will <span data-x="terminate a worklet global scope">terminate</span> the
  corresponding <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code> and allow it to be garbage-collected.</p>

  <p>Additionally, user agents may, at any time, <span data-x="terminate a worklet global
  scope">terminate</span> a given <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code>, unless the specification defining
  the corresponding worklet type says otherwise. For example, they might terminate them if the
  <span>worklet agent</span>'s <span data-x="concept-agent-event-loop">event loop</span> has no
  <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> queued, or if the user agent has no pending operations
  planning to make use of the worklet, or if the user agent detects abnormal operations such as
  infinite loops or callbacks exceeding imposed time limits.</p>

  <p>Finally, specifications for specific worklet types can give more specific details on when to
  <span data-x="create a worklet global scope">create</span> <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code>s for a
  given worklet type. For example, they might create them during specific processes that call upon
  worklet code, as in the <a href="#worklets-example-registering">example</a>.</p>
