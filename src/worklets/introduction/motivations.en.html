  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Allowing extension points to rendering, or other sensitive parts of the implementation pipeline
  such as audio output, is difficult. If extension points were done with full access to the APIs
  available on <code>Window</code>, engines would need to abandon previously-held assumptions for
  what could happen in the middle of those phases. For example, during the layout phase, rendering
  engines assume that no DOM will be modified.</p>

  <p>Additionaly, defining extension points in the <code>Window</code> environment would restrict
  user agents to performing work in the same thread as the <code>Window</code> object. (Unless
  implementations added complex, high-overhead infrastructure to allow thread-safe APIs, as well
  as thread-joining guarantees.)</p>

  <p>Worklets are designed to allow extension points, while keeping guarantees that user agents
  currently rely on. This is done through new global environments, based on subclasses of
  <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code>.</p>

  <p>Worklets are similar to web workers. However, they:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>Are thread-agnostic. That is, they are not designed to run on a dedicated separate thread,
   like each worker is. Implementations can run worklets wherever they choose (including on the main
   thread).</p></li>

   <li><p>Are able to have multiple duplicate instances of the global scope created, for the purpose
   of parallelism.</p></li>

   <li><p>Do not use an event-based API. Instead, classes are registered on the global scope, whose
   methods are invoked by the user agent.</p></li>

   <li><p>Have a reduced API surface on the global scope.</p></li>

   <li><p>Have a lifetime for their <span>global object</span> which is defined by other
   specifications, often in an <span>implementation-defined</span> manner.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>As worklets have relatively high overhead, they are best used sparingly. Due to this, a given
  <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code> is expected to be shared between multiple separate scripts. (This
  is similar to how a single <code>Window</code> is shared between multiple separate scripts.)</p>

  <p>Worklets are a general technology that serve different use cases. Some worklets, such as those
  defined in <cite>CSS Painting API</cite>, provide extension points intended for stateless,
  idempotent, and short-running computations, which have special considerations as described in the
  next couple of sections. Others, such as those defined in <cite>Web Audio API</cite>, are used for
  stateful, long-running operations. <ref spec=CSSPAINT> <ref spec=WEBAUDIO></p>
