  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>Worklets are a piece of specification infrastructure which can be used for running scripts
  independent of the main JavaScript execution environment, while not requiring any particular
  implementation model.</p>

  <p>The worklet infrastructure specified here cannot be used directly by web developers. Instead,
  other specifications build upon it to create directly-usable worklet types, specialized for
  running in particular parts of the browser implementation pipeline.</p>
