  <h4 id="worklets-idempotent">Code idempotence</h4>

  <p>Some specifications which use worklets are intended to allow user agents to parallelize work
  over multiple threads, or to move work between threads as required. In these specifications, user
  agents might invoke methods on a web-developer-provided class in an
  <span>implementation-defined</span> order.</p>

  <p>As a result of this, to prevent interoperability issues, authors who register classes on such
  <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code>s should make their code idempotent. That is, a method or set of
  methods on the class should produce the same output given a particular input.</p>

  <p>This specification uses the following techniques in order to encourage authors to write code in
  an idempotent way:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>No reference to the global object is available (i.e., there is no counterpart to <code
    data-x="dom-WorkerGlobalScope-self">self</code> on <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code>.</p>

    <p class="XXX">Although this was the intention when worklets were first specified, the
    introduction of <code data-x="">globalThis</code> has made it no longer true. See <a
    href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/6059">issue #6059</a> for more discussion.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>Code is loaded as a <span>module script</span>, which results in the code being executed
   in strict mode and with no shared <code data-x="">this</code> referencing the global
   proxy.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Together, these restrictions help prevent two different scripts from sharing state using
  properties of the <span>global object</span>.</p>

  <p>Additionally, specifications which use worklets and intend to allow
  <span>implementation-defined</span> behavior must obey the following:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>They must require user agents to always have at least two <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code>
   instances per <code>Worklet</code>, and randomly assign a method or set of methods on a class to
   a particular <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code> instance. These specifications may provide an
   opt-out under memory constraints.</p></li>

   <li><p>These specifications must allow user agents to create and destroy instances of their
   <code>WorkletGlobalScope</code> subclasses at any time.</p></li>
  </ul>
