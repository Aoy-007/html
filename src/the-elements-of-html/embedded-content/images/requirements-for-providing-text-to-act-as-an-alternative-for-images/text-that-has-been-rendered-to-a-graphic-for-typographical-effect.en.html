  <h6>Text that has been rendered to a graphic for typographical effect</h6>

  <p>Sometimes, an image just consists of text, and the purpose of the image is not to highlight the
  actual typographic effects used to render the text, but just to convey the text itself.</p>

  <p>In such cases, the <code data-x="attr-img-alt">alt</code> attribute must be present but must
  consist of the same text as written in the image itself.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>Consider a graphic containing the text "Earth Day", but with the letters all decorated with
   flowers and plants. If the text is merely being used as a heading, to spice up the page for
   graphical users, then the correct alternative text is just the same text "Earth Day", and no
   mention need be made of the decorations:</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;h1><strong>&lt;img src="earthdayheading.png" alt="Earth Day"></strong>&lt;/h1></code></pre>

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   <p>An illuminated manuscript might use graphics for some of its images. The alternative text in
   such a situation is just the character that the image represents.</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p>&lt;img src="initials/o.svg" alt="O">nce upon a time and a long long time ago, late at
night, when it was dark, over the hills, through the woods, across a great ocean, in a land far
away, in a small house, on a hill, under a full moon...</code></pre> <!-- The End. -->

  </div>

  <p>When an image is used to represent a character that cannot otherwise be represented in Unicode,
  for example gaiji, itaiji, or new characters such as novel currency symbols, the alternative text
  should be a more conventional way of writing the same thing, e.g. using the phonetic hiragana or
  katakana to give the character's pronunciation.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>In this example from 1997, a new-fangled currency symbol that looks like a curly E with two
   bars in the middle instead of one is represented using an image. The alternative text gives the
   character's pronunciation.</p>

   <pre><code class="html" data-x="">&lt;p>Only &lt;img src="euro.png" alt="euro ">5.99!</code></pre>

  </div>

  <p>An image should not be used if characters would serve an identical purpose. Only when the text
  cannot be directly represented using text, e.g., because of decorations or because there is no
  appropriate character (as in the case of gaiji), would an image be appropriate.</p>

  <p class="note">If an author is tempted to use an image because their default system font does not
  support a given character, then Web Fonts are a better solution than images.</p>
