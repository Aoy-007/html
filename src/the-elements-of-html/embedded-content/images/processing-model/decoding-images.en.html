  <h6>Decoding images</h6>

  <p>Image data is usually encoded in order to reduce file size. This means that in order for the
  user agent to present the image to the screen, the data needs to be decoded.
  <dfn data-x="img-decoding-process">Decoding</dfn> is the process which converts an image's media
  data into a bitmap form, suitable for presentation to the screen. Note that this process can be
  slow relative to other processes involved in presenting content. Thus, the user agent can choose
  when to perform decoding, in order to create the best user experience.</p>

  <p>Image decoding is said to be synchronous if it prevents presentation of other content until it
  is finished. Typically, this has an effect of atomically presenting the image and any other
  content at the same time. However, this presentation is delayed by the amount of time it takes to
  perform the decode.</p>

  <p>Image decoding is said to be asynchronous if it does not prevent presentation of other content.
  This has an effect of presenting non-image content faster. However, the image content is missing
  on screen until the decode finishes. Once the decode is finished, the screen is updated with the
  image.</p>

  <p>In both synchronous and asynchronous decoding modes, the final content is presented to screen
  after the same amount of time has elapsed. The main difference is whether the user agent presents
  non-image content ahead of presenting the final content.</p>

  <p>In order to aid the user agent in deciding whether to perform synchronous or asynchronous
  decode, the <code data-x="attr-img-decoding">decoding</code> attribute can be set on
  <code>img</code> elements. The possible values of of the <code
  data-x="attr-img-decoding">decoding</code> attribute are the following <dfn>image decoding
  hint</dfn> keywords:</p>

  <table>
   <thead>
    <tr>
     <th>Keyword
     <th>State
     <th>Description
   <tbody>
    <tr>
     <td><dfn><code data-x="attr-img-decoding-sync">sync</code></dfn>
     <td><dfn data-x="attr-img-decoding-sync-state">Sync</dfn>
     <td>Indicates a preference to <span data-x="img-decoding-process">decode</span> this image
     synchronously for atomic presentation with other content.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn><code data-x="attr-img-decoding-async">async</code></dfn>
     <td><dfn data-x="attr-img-decoding-async-state">Async</dfn>
     <td>Indicates a preference to <span data-x="img-decoding-process">decode</span> this image
     asynchronously to avoid delaying presentation of other content.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn><code data-x="attr-img-decoding-auto">auto</code></dfn>
     <td><dfn data-x="attr-img-decoding-auto-state">Auto</dfn>
     <td>Indicates no preference in decoding mode (the default).
  </table>

  <p>When <span data-x="img-decoding-process">decoding</span> an image, the user agent should
  respect the preference indicated by the <code data-x="attr-img-decoding">decoding</code>
  attribute's state. If the state indicated is <span
  data-x="attr-img-decoding-auto-state">auto</span>, then the user agent is free to choose any
  decoding behavior.</p>

  <p class="note">It is also possible to control the decoding behavior using the <code
  data-x="dom-img-decode">decode()</code> method. Since the <code
  data-x="dom-img-decode">decode()</code> method performs <span
  data-x="img-decoding-process">decoding</span> independently from the process responsible for
  presenting content to screen, it is unaffected by the <code
  data-x="attr-img-decoding">decoding</code> attribute.</p>
