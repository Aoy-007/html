  <h6>When to obtain images</h6>

  <p>By default, images are obtained immediately. User agents may provide users with the option to
  instead obtain them on-demand. (The on-demand option might be used by bandwidth-constrained users,
  for example.)</p>

  <p>When obtaining images immediately, the user agent must synchronously <span>update the image
  data</span> of the <code>img</code> element, with the <i>restart animation</i> flag set if so
  stated, whenever that element is created or has experienced <span>relevant mutations</span>.</p>

  <p>When obtaining images on demand, the user agent must <span>update the image data</span> of an
  <code>img</code> element whenever it needs the image data (i.e., on demand), but only if the
  <code>img</code> element's <span>current request</span>'s <span
  data-x="img-req-state">state</span> is <span data-x="img-none">unavailable</span>. When an
  <code>img</code> element has experienced <span>relevant mutations</span>, if the user agent only
  obtains images on demand, the <code>img</code> element's <span>current request</span>'s <span
  data-x="img-req-state">state</span> must return to <span data-x="img-none">unavailable</span>.</p>
