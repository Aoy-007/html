  <h5 id="scriptingLanguages">Scripting languages</h5>

  <p w-nodev>User agents are not required to support JavaScript. This standard needs to be updated
  if a language other than JavaScript comes along and gets similar wide adoption by web browsers.
  Until such a time, implementing other languages is in conflict with this standard, given the
  processing model defined for the <code>script</code> element.</p>

  <p>Servers should use <code>text/javascript</code> for JavaScript resources. Servers should not
  use other <span data-x="JavaScript MIME type">JavaScript MIME types</span> for JavaScript
  resources, and must not use non-<span data-x="JavaScript MIME type">JavaScript MIME
  types</span>.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>For external JavaScript resources, MIME type parameters in `<code>Content-Type</code>` headers
  are generally ignored. (In some cases the `<code data-x="">charset</code>` parameter has an
  effect.) However, for the <code>script</code> element's <code
  data-x="attr-script-type">type</code> attribute they are significant; it uses the <span>JavaScript
  MIME type essence match</span> concept.</p>

  <p class="note">For example, scripts with their <code data-x="attr-script-type">type</code>
  attribute set to "<code data-x="">text/javascript; charset=utf-8</code>" will not be
  evaluated, even though that is a valid <span>JavaScript MIME type</span> when parsed.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, again for external JavaScript resources, special considerations apply around
  `<code>Content-Type</code>` header processing as detailed in the <span>prepare a script</span>
  algorithm and <cite>Fetch</cite>. <ref spec=FETCH>
