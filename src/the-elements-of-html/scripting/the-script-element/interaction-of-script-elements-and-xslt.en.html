  <h5 id="scriptTagXSLT">Interaction of <code>script</code> elements and XSLT</h5>

  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>This specification does not define how XSLT interacts with the <code>script</code> element.
  However, in the absence of another specification actually defining this, here are some guidelines
  for implementers, based on existing implementations:</p>

  <ul>

   <li><p>When an XSLT transformation program is triggered by an <code
   data-x="">&lt;?xml-stylesheet?></code> processing instruction and the browser implements a
   direct-to-DOM transformation, <code>script</code> elements created by the XSLT processor need to
   have its <span>parser document</span> set correctly, and run in document order (modulo scripts
   marked <code data-x="attr-script-defer">defer</code> or <code
   data-x="attr-script-async">async</code>), <span>immediately</span>, as the transformation is
   occurring.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <code>XSLTProcessor</code> <code
   data-x="dom-XSLTProcessor-transformToDocument">transformToDocument()</code> method adds elements
   to a <code>Document</code> object with a null <span data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing
   context</span>, and, accordingly, any <code>script</code> elements they create need to have their
   <span>"already started"</span> flag set in the <span>prepare a script</span> algorithm and never
   get executed (<span data-x="concept-environment-noscript">scripting is disabled</span>). Such
   <code>script</code> elements still need to have their <span>parser document</span> set, though,
   such that their <code data-x="dom-script-async">async</code> IDL attribute will return false in
   the absence of an <code data-x="attr-script-async">async</code> content attribute.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <code>XSLTProcessor</code> <code
   data-x="dom-XSLTProcessor-transformToFragment">transformToFragment()</code> method needs to
   create a fragment that is equivalent to one built manually by creating the elements using <code
   data-x="dom-document-createElementNS">document.createElementNS()</code>. For instance, it needs
   to create <code>script</code> elements with null <span>parser document</span> and that don't have
   their <span>"already started"</span> flag set, so that they will execute when the fragment is
   inserted into a document.</p></li>

  </ul>

  <p>The main distinction between the first two cases and the last case is that the first two
  operate on <code>Document</code>s and the last operates on a fragment.</p>
