  <h5>Other metadata names</h5>

  <p>Anyone can create and use their own <dfn data-x="concept-meta-extensions">extensions to the
  predefined set of metadata names</dfn>. There is no requirement to register such extensions.</p>

  <p>However, a new metadata name should not be created in any of the following cases:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>If either the name is a <span>URL</span>, or the value of its accompanying <code
   data-x="attr-meta-content">content</code> attribute is a <span>URL</span>; in those cases,
   registering it as an <span data-x="concept-rel-extensions">extension to the predefined set of
   link types</span> is encouraged (rather than creating a new metadata name).</p></li>

   <li><p>If the name is for something expected to have processing requirements in user agents; in
   that case it ought to be standardized.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Also, before creating and using a new metadata name, consulting the <a
  href="https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions">WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page</a> is
  encouraged â€” to avoid choosing a metadata name that's already in use, and to avoid duplicating the
  purpose of any metadata names that are already in use, and to avoid new standardized names
  clashing with your chosen name. <ref spec=WHATWGWIKI></p>

  <p>Anyone is free to edit the WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page at any time to add a metadata name.
  New metadata names can be specified with the following information:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>Keyword</dt>

   <dd><p>The actual name being defined. The name should not be confusingly similar to any other
   defined name (e.g. differing only in case).</p></dd>


   <dt>Brief description</dt>

   <dd><p>A short non-normative description of what the metadata name's meaning is, including the
   format the value is required to be in.</p></dd>


   <dt>Specification</dt>

   <dd>A link to a more detailed description of the metadata name's semantics and requirements. It
   could be another page on the Wiki, or a link to an external page.</dd>


   <dt>Synonyms</dt>

   <dd><p>A list of other names that have exactly the same processing requirements. Authors should
   not use the names defined to be synonyms (they are only intended to allow user agents to support
   legacy content). Anyone may remove synonyms that are not used in practice; only names that need to
   be processed as synonyms for compatibility with legacy content are to be registered in this
   way.</p></dd>


   <dt>Status</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>One of the following:</p>

    <dl>
     <dt>Proposed</dt>

     <dd>The name has not received wide peer review and approval. Someone has proposed it and is, or
     soon will be, using it.</dd>

     <dt>Ratified</dt>

     <dd>The name has received wide peer review and approval. It has a specification that
     unambiguously defines how to handle pages that use the name, including when they use it in
     incorrect ways.</dd>

     <dt>Discontinued</dt>

     <dd>The metadata name has received wide peer review and it has been found wanting. Existing
     pages are using this metadata name, but new pages should avoid it. The "brief description" and
     "specification" entries will give details of what authors should use instead, if anything.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>If a metadata name is found to be redundant with existing values, it should be removed and
    listed as a synonym for the existing value.</p>

    <p>If a metadata name is added in the "proposed" state for a period of a month or more without
    being used or specified, then it may be removed from the WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page.</p>

    <p>If a metadata name is added with the "proposed" status and found to be redundant with
    existing values, it should be removed and listed as a synonym for the existing value. If a
    metadata name is added with the "proposed" status and found to be harmful, then it should be
    changed to "discontinued" status.</p>

    <p>Anyone can change the status at any time, but should only do so in accordance with the
    definitions above.</p>
