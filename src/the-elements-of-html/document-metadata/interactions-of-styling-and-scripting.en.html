  <h4>Interactions of styling and scripting</h4>

  <p>If the style sheet referenced no other resources (e.g., it was an internal style sheet given by
  a <code>style</code> element with no <code data-x="">@import</code> rules), then the style rules
  must be <span>immediately</span> made available to script; otherwise, the style rules must only be
  made available to script once the <span>event loop</span> reaches its <span>update the
  rendering</span> step.</p>

  <p id="a-style-sheet-that-is-blocking-scripts">An element <var>el</var> in the context of a
  <code>Document</code> of an <span>HTML parser</span> or <span>XML parser</span> <dfn>contributes a
  script-blocking style sheet</dfn> if all of the following conditions are true:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p><var>el</var> was created by that <code>Document</code>'s parser.</p></li>

   <li><p><var>el</var> is either a <code>style</code> element or a <code>link</code> element that
   was an <span data-x="rel-stylesheet">external resource link that contributes to the styling
   processing model</span> when the <var>el</var> was created by the parser.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <var>el</var> is a <code>link</code> element, it's <code
   data-x="attr-link-media">media</code> attribute's value <span>matches the
   environment</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><var>el</var>'s style sheet was enabled when the element was created by the
   parser.</p></li>

   <li><p>The last time the <span>event loop</span> reached <a href="#step1">step 1</a>,
   <var>el</var>'s <span>root</span> was that <code>Document</code>.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>The user agent hasn't given up on loading that particular style sheet yet. A user agent
    may give up on loading a style sheet at any time.</p>

    <p class="note">Giving up on a style sheet before the style sheet loads, if the style sheet
    eventually does still load, means that the script might end up operating with incorrect
    information. For example, if a style sheet sets the color of an element to green, but a script
    that inspects the resulting style is executed before the sheet is loaded, the script will find
    that the element is black (or whatever the default color is), and might thus make poor choices
    (e.g., deciding to use black as the color elsewhere on the page, instead of green). Implementers
    have to balance the likelihood of a script using incorrect information with the performance impact
    of doing nothing while waiting for a slow network request to finish.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="XXX">It is expected that counterparts to the above rules also apply to
  <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?></code> PIs and HTTP `<code data-x="http-link">Link</code>` headers.
  However, this has not yet been thoroughly investigated.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> has a <dfn>script-blocking style sheet counter</dfn>, which is a
  number, initially 0.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> <dfn>has a style sheet that is blocking scripts</dfn> if its
  <span>script-blocking style sheet counter</span> is greater than 0, or if that
  <code>Document</code> has a non-null <span data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span>
  whose <span data-x="bc-container-document">container document</span> is non-null and has a
  <span>script-blocking style sheet counter</span> greater than 0.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> <dfn>has no style sheet that is blocking scripts</dfn> if it does not
  <span data-x="has a style sheet that is blocking scripts">have a style sheet that is blocking
  scripts</span> as defined in the previous paragraph.</p>
