  <h5>Processing `<code data-x="http-link">Link</code>` headers</h5>

  <p>HTTP `<code data-x="http-link">Link</code>` headers, if supported, must be assumed to come
  before any links in the document, in the order that they were given in the HTTP message. These
  headers are to be processed according to the rules given in the relevant specifications. <ref
  spec=HTTP> <ref spec=WEBLINK></p> <!-- WEBLINK is ref for Link: header -->

  <p class="note">Registration of relation types in HTTP `<code data-x="http-link">Link</code>`
  headers is distinct from <a href="#linkTypes">HTML link types</a>, and thus their semantics can be
  different from same-named HTML types.</p>
