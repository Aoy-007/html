  <h5>Processing the <code data-x="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute</h5>

  <p>If the <code data-x="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute is present, then the user agent must
  assume that the resource is of the given type (even if that is not a <span>valid MIME type
  string</span>, e.g. the empty string). If the attribute is omitted, but the <span>external
  resource link</span> type has a default type defined, then the user agent must assume that the
  resource is of that type. If the UA does not support the given <span>MIME type</span> for the
  given link relationship, then the UA should not <span data-x="concept-link-obtain">obtain</span>
  the resource; if the UA does support the given <span>MIME type</span> for the given link
  relationship, then the UA should <span data-x="concept-link-obtain">obtain</span> the resource at
  the appropriate time as specified for the <span>external resource link</span>'s particular type.
  If the attribute is omitted, and the <span>external resource link</span> type does not have a
  default type defined, but the user agent would <span data-x="concept-link-obtain">obtain</span>
  the resource if the type was known and supported, then the user agent should <span
  data-x="concept-link-obtain">obtain</span> the resource under the assumption that it will be
  supported.</p>

  <p>User agents must not consider the <code data-x="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute
  authoritative &mdash; upon fetching the resource, user agents must not use the <code
  data-x="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute to determine its actual type. Only the actual type
  (as defined in the next paragraph) is used to determine whether to <em>apply</em> the resource,
  not the aforementioned assumed type.</p>

  <p id="concept-link-type-sniffing">If the <span>external resource link</span> type defines rules
  for processing the resource's <span data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span>, then those
  rules apply.  Otherwise, if the resource is expected to be an image, user agents may apply the
  <span data-x="Content-Type sniffing: image">image sniffing rules</span>, with the <var>official
  type</var> being the type determined from the resource's <span data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type
  metadata</span>, and use the resulting <span data-x="Content-Type sniffing">computed type of the
  resource</span> as if it was the actual type.  Otherwise, if neither of these conditions apply or
  if the user agent opts not to apply the image sniffing rules, then the user agent must use the
  resource's <span data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span> to determine the type of the
  resource. If there is no type metadata, but the <span>external resource link</span> type has a
  default type defined, then the user agent must assume that the resource is of that type.</p>

  <p class="note">The <code data-x="rel-stylesheet">stylesheet</code> link type defines rules for
  processing the resource's <span data-x="Content-Type">Content-Type metadata</span>.</p>

  <p>Once the user agent has established the type of the resource, the user agent must apply the
  resource if it is of a supported type and the other relevant conditions apply, and must ignore the
  resource otherwise.</p>

  <div class="example">

   <p>If a document contains style sheet links labeled as follows:</p>

   <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="A" type="text/plain"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="B" type="text/css"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="C"&gt;</pre>

   <p>...then a compliant UA that supported only CSS style sheets would fetch the B and C files, and
   skip the A file (since <code>text/plain</code> is not the <span>MIME type</span> for CSS style
   sheets).</p>

   <p>For files B and C, it would then check the actual types returned by the server. For those that
   are sent as <code>text/css</code>, it would apply the styles, but for those labeled as
   <code>text/plain</code>, or any other type, it would not.</p>

   <p>If one of the two files was returned without a <span>Content-Type</span> metadata, or with a
   syntactically incorrect type like <code data-x="">Content-Type:&nbsp;"null"</code>, then the
   default type for <code data-x="rel-stylesheet">stylesheet</code> links would kick in. Since that
   default type is <code>text/css</code>, the style sheet <em>would</em> nonetheless be applied.</p>
