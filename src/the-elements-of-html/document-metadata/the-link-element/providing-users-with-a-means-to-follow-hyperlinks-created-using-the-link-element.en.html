  <h5>Providing users with a means to follow hyperlinks created using the <code>link</code>
  element</h5>

  <p id="linkui">Interactive user agents may provide users with a means to <span data-x="following
  hyperlinks">follow the hyperlinks</span> created using the <code>link</code> element, somewhere
  within their user interface. The exact interface is not defined by this specification, but it
  could include the following information (obtained from the element's attributes, again as defined
  below), in some form or another (possibly simplified), for each <span>hyperlink</span> created
  with each <code>link</code> element in the document:</p>

  <ul> <!-- the order here is the order that makes most sense for a UI -->

   <li>The relationship between this document and the resource (given by the <code
   data-x="attr-link-rel">rel</code> attribute)</li>

   <li>The title of the resource (given by the <code data-x="attr-link-title">title</code>
   attribute).</li>

   <li>The address of the resource (given by the <code data-x="attr-link-href">href</code>
   attribute).</li>

   <li>The language of the resource (given by the <code data-x="attr-link-hreflang">hreflang</code>
   attribute).</li>

   <li>The optimum media for the resource (given by the <code data-x="attr-link-media">media</code>
   attribute).</li>

  </ul>

  <p>User agents could also include other information, such as the type of the resource (as given by
  the <code data-x="attr-link-type">type</code> attribute).</p>

  <!-- c.f. <a> and <area>'s similar sections -->
  <p>The <span>activation behavior</span> of <code>link</code> elements that create <span
  data-x="hyperlink">hyperlinks</span> is to <span data-x="following hyperlinks">follow the
  hyperlink</span> created by the <code>link</code> element.</p>
