  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>As specified below, and alluded to above, simply defining and using an element called
  <code data-x="">taco-button</code> does not mean that such elements <span
  data-x="represents">represent</span> buttons. That is, tools such as web browsers, search engines,
  or accessibility technology will not automatically treat the resulting element as a button just
  based on its defined name.</p>

  <p>To convey the desired button semantics to a variety of users, while still using an
  <span>autonomous custom element</span>, a number of techniques would need to be employed:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>The addition of the <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute would make the
   <code data-x="">taco-button</code> <span>focusable</span>. Note that if the
   <code data-x="">taco-button</code> were to become logically disabled, the <code
   data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute would need to be removed.</p></li>

   <li><p>The addition of an ARIA role and various ARIA states and properties helps convey semantics
   to accessibility technology. For example, setting the <span>role</span> to "<code
   data-x="attr-aria-role-button">button</code>" will convey the semantics that this is a button,
   enabling users to successfully interact with the control using usual button-like interactions in
   their accessibility technology. Setting the <code data-x="attr-aria-label">aria-label</code>
   property is necessary to give the button an <span data-x="concept-accessible-name">accessible
   name</span>, instead of having accessibility technology traverse its child text nodes and
   announce them. And setting the <code data-x="attr-aria-disabled">aria-disabled</code> state to
   "<code data-x="">true</code>" when the button is logically disabled conveys to accessibility
   technology the button's disabled state.</p></li>

   <li><p>The addition of event handlers to handle commonly-expected button behaviors helps convey
   the semantics of the button to web browser users. In this case, the most relevant event handler
   would be one that proxies appropriate <code data-x="event-keydown">keydown</code> events to
   become <code data-x="event-click">click</code> events, so that you can activate the button both
   with keyboard and by clicking.</li>

   <li><p>In addition to any default visual styling provided for <code data-x="">taco-button</code>
   elements, the visual styling will also need to be updated to reflect changes in logical state,
   such as becoming disabled; that is, whatever style sheet has rules for <code
   data-x="">taco-button</code> will also need to have rules for <code
   data-x="">taco-button[disabled]</code>.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>With these points in mind, a full-featured <code data-x="">taco-button</code> that took on the
  responsibility of conveying button semantics (including the ability to be disabled) might look
  something like this:</p>

  <pre><code class="js">class TacoButton extends HTMLElement {
  static get observedAttributes() { return ["disabled"]; }

  constructor() {
    super();
    this._internals = this.attachInternals();
    this._internals.role = "button";

    this.addEventListener("keydown", e => {
      if (e.code === "Enter" || e.code === "Space") {
        this.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent("click", {
          bubbles: true,
          cancelable: true
        }));
      }
    });

    this.addEventListener("click", e => {
      if (this.disabled) {
        e.preventDefault();
        e.stopImmediatePropagation();
      }
    });

    this._observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
      this._internals.ariaLabel = this.textContent;
    });
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    this.setAttribute("tabindex", "0");

    this._observer.observe(this, {
      childList: true,
      characterData: true,
      subtree: true
    });
  }

  disconnectedCallback() {
    this._observer.disconnect();
  }

  get disabled() {
    return this.hasAttribute("disabled");
  }
  set disabled(flag) {
    this.toggleAttribute("disabled", Boolean(flag));
  }

  attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
    // name will always be "disabled" due to observedAttributes
    if (this.disabled) {
      this.removeAttribute("tabindex");
      this._internals.ariaDisabled = "true";
    } else {
      this.setAttribute("tabindex", "0");
      this._internals.ariaDisabled = "false";
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

  <p>Even with this rather-complicated element definition, the element is not a pleasure to use for
  consumers: it will be continually "sprouting" <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code>
  attributes of its own volition, and its choice of <code data-x="">tabindex="0"</code> focusability
  behavior may not match the <code>button</code> behavior on the current platform. This is because
  as of now there is no way to specify default focus behavior for custom elements, forcing the use
  of the <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute to do so (even though it is usually
  reserved for allowing the consumer to override default behavior).</p>

  <p>In contrast, a simple <span>customized built-in element</span>, as shown in the previous
  section, would automatically inherit the semantics and behavior of the <code>button</code>
  element, with no need to implement these behaviors manually. In general, for any elements with
  nontrivial behavior and semantics that build on top of existing elements of HTML, <span
  data-x="customized built-in element">customized built-in elements</span> will be easier to
  develop, maintain, and consume.</p>
