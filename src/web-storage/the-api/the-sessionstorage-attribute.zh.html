  <h4>The <code data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> attribute</h4>

  <pre><code class="idl" data-x="">interface mixin <dfn>WindowSessionStorage</dfn> {
  readonly attribute <span>Storage</span> <span data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</span>;
};
<span>Window</span> includes <span>WindowSessionStorage</span>;</code></pre>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code></dfn> attribute represents the
  set of storage areas specific to the current <span>top-level browsing context</span>.</p>

  <dl class="domintro">
   <dt><var>window</var> . <code subdfn data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code></dt>
   <dd>
     <p>Returns the <code>Storage</code> object associated with that origin's session storage
     area.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Each <span>top-level browsing context</span> has a unique set of session storage areas, one for
  each <span>origin</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents should not expire data from a browsing context's session storage areas, but may do
  so when the user requests that such data be deleted, or when the UA detects that it has limited
  storage space, or for security reasons. User agents should always avoid deleting data while a
  script that could access that data is running. When a top-level browsing context is destroyed (and
  therefore permanently inaccessible to the user) the data stored in its session storage areas can
  be discarded with it, as the API described in this specification provides no way for that data to
  ever be subsequently retrieved.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p class="note">The lifetime of a browsing context can be unrelated to the lifetime of the actual
  user agent process itself, as the user agent can support resuming sessions after a restart.</p>

  <p>When a new <code>Document</code> is created in a <span>browsing context</span> which has a
  <span>top-level browsing context</span>, the user agent must check to see if that <span>top-level
  browsing context</span> has a session storage area for that document's <span>origin</span>. If it
  does, then that is the <code>Document</code>'s assigned session storage area. If it does not, a
  new storage area for that document's <span>origin</span> must be created, and then <em>that</em>
  is the <code>Document</code>'s assigned session storage area. A <code>Document</code>'s assigned
  storage area does not change during the lifetime of a <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p class="note">In the case of an <code>iframe</code> being moved to another
  <code>Document</code>, the nested browsing context is destroyed and a new one created.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> attribute must return a
  <code>Storage</code> object associated with the <code>Document</code>'s assigned session storage
  area. Each <code>Document</code> object must have a separate object for its <code>Window</code>'s
  <code data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>While <span>creating a new browsing context</span>, the session storage area <a
  href="#copy-session-storage">is sometimes copied</a> over.</p>

  </div>

  <p id="sessionStorageEvent">When the <code data-x="dom-Storage-setItem">setItem()</code>, <code
  data-x="dom-Storage-removeItem">removeItem()</code>, and <code
  data-x="dom-Storage-clear">clear()</code> methods are called on a <code>Storage</code> object <var>x</var> that is associated with a session storage area, if the methods did not throw an
  exception or "do nothing" as defined above, then for every <code>Document</code> object whose
  <code>Window</code> object's <code data-x="dom-sessionStorage">sessionStorage</code> attribute's
  <code>Storage</code> object is associated with the same storage area, other than <var>x</var>,
  user agents <span>send a storage notification</span>.</p>
