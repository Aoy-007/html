  <h4 export data-lt="transferable object"><dfn>Transferable objects</dfn></h4>

  <p><span>Transferable objects</span> support being transferred across <span
  data-x="agent">agents</span>. Transferring is effectively recreating the object while sharing a
  reference to the underlying data and then detaching the object being transferred. This is useful
  to transfer ownership of expensive resources. Not all objects are <span>transferable
  objects</span> and not all aspects of objects that are <span>transferable objects</span> are
  necessarily preserved when transferred.</p>

  <p class="note">Transferring is an irreversible and non-idempotent operation. Once an object has
  been transferred, it cannot be transferred, or indeed used, again.</p>

  <p><span data-x="platform object">Platform objects</span> can be <span>transferable objects</span>
  if their <span>primary interface</span> is decorated with the <dfn extended-attribute
  data-lt="Transferable" data-x="Transferable"><code>[Transferable]</code></dfn> IDL <span>extended
  attribute</span>. Such interfaces must also define the following algorithms:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn export>transfer steps</dfn>, taking a <span>platform object</span>
   <var>value</var> and a <span>Record</span> <var>dataHolder</var></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>A set of steps that transfers the data in <var>value</var> into fields of
    <var>dataHolder</var>. The resulting data held in <var>dataHolder</var> must be
    independent of any <span>JavaScript Realm</span>.</p>

    <p>These steps may throw an exception if transferral is not possible.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><dfn export>transfer-receiving steps</dfn>, taking a <span>Record</span>
   <var>dataHolder</var> and a <span>platform object</span> <var>value</var></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>A set of steps that receives the data in <var>dataHolder</var>, using it to set up
    <var>value</var> as appropriate. <var>value</var> will be a newly-created instance of the
    <span>platform object</span> type in question, with none of its internal data set up; setting
    that up is the job of these steps.</p>

    <p>These steps may throw an exception if it is not possible to receive the transfer.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>It is up to the definition of individual platform objects to determine what data is transferred
  by these steps. Typically the steps are very symmetric.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="Transferable">[Transferable]</code> extended attribute must take no
  arguments, and must only appear on an interface. It must not appear more than once on an
  interface.</p>

  <p>For a given <span>platform object</span>, only the object's <span>primary interface</span> is
  considered during the transferring process. Thus, if inheritance is involved in defining the
  interface, each <code data-x="Transferable">[Transferable]</code>-annotated interface in the
  inheritance chain needs to define standalone <span>transfer steps</span> and
  <span>transfer-receiving steps</span>, including taking into account any important data that might
  come from inherited interfaces.</p>

  <p><span data-x="platform object">Platform objects</span> that are <span>transferable
  objects</span> have a <dfn for="platform object" attribute>[[Detached]]</dfn> internal slot. This
  is used to ensure that once a platform object has been transferred, it cannot be transferred
  again.</p>

  <p>Objects defined in the JavaScript specification are handled by the
  <span>StructuredSerializeWithTransfer</span> abstract operation directly.</p>
