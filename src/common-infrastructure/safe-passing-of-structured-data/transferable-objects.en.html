  <h4 data-export="" data-lt="transferable object"><dfn>Transferable objects</dfn></h4>

  <p><span>Transferable objects</span> support being transferred across <span data-x="event
  loop">event loops</span>. Transferring is effectively recreating the object while sharing a
  reference to the underlying data and then detaching the object being transferred. This is useful
  to transfer ownership of expensive resources. Not all objects are <span>transferable
  objects</span> and not all aspects of objects that are <span>transferable objects</span> are
  necessarily preserved when transferred.</p>

  <p class="note">Transferring is an irreversible and non-idempotent operation. Once an object has
  been transferred, it cannot be transferred, or indeed used, again.</p>

  <p><span data-x="platform object">Platform objects</span> can be <span>transferable objects</span>
  if they implement only interfaces decorated with the <dfn data-export=""
  data-dfn-type="extended-attribute" data-lt="Transferable"
  data-x="Transferable"><code>[Transferable]</code></dfn> IDL <span>extended attribute</span>. Such
  interfaces must also define the following algorithms:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn data-export="">transfer steps</dfn>, taking a <span>platform object</span>
   <var>value</var> and a <span>Record</span> <var>dataHolder</var></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>A set of steps that transfers the data in <var>input</var> into fields of
    <var>dataHolder</var>. The resulting data held in <var>dataHolder</var> must be
    independent of any <span>JavaScript Realm</span>.</p>

    <p>These steps may throw an exception if transferral is not possible.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><dfn data-export="">transfer-receiving steps</dfn>, taking a <span>Record</span>
   <var>dataHolder</var> and a <span>platform object</span> <var>value</var></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>A set of steps that receives the data in <var>dataHolder</var>, using it to set up
    <var>value</var> as appropriate. <var>value</var> will be a newly-created instance of the
    <span>platform object</span> type in question, with none of its internal data set up; setting
    that up is the job of these steps.</p>

    <p>These steps may throw an exception if it is not possible to receive the transfer.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>It is up to the definition of individual platform objects to determine what data is transferred
  by these steps. Typically the steps are very symmetric.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="Transferable">[Transferable]</code> extended attribute must take no
  arguments, and must not appear on anything other than an interface. It must appear only once on an
  interface. It must not be used on a callback interface. If it appears on a partial interface or an
  interface that is really a mixin, then it must also appear on the original or mixed-in-to
  interface, and any supplied <span>serialization steps</span> and <span>deserialization
  steps</span> for the partial interface or mixin should be understood as being appended to those of
  the original or mixed-in-to interface.</p>

  <p><span data-x="platform object">Platform objects</span> that are <span>transferable
  objects</span> have a <dfn data-export="" data-dfn-for="platform object"
  data-dfn-type="attribute">[[Detached]]</dfn> internal slot. This is used to ensure that once a
  platform object has been transferred, it cannot be transferred again.</p>

  <p>Objects defined in the JavaScript specification are handled by the
  <span>StructuredSerializeWithTransfer</span> abstract operation directly.</p>
