  <h4 id="performing-structured-clones-from-other-specifications">Performing serialization and
  transferring from other specifications</h4>

  <p>Other specifications may use the abstract operations defined here. The following provides
  some guidance on when each abstract operation is typically useful, with examples.</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><span>StructuredSerializeWithTransfer</span></dt>
   <dt><span>StructuredDeserializeWithTransfer</span></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Cloning a value to another <span>JavaScript Realm</span>, with a transfer list, but where the
    target Realm is not known ahead of time. In this case the serialization step can be performed
    immediately, with the deserialization step delayed until the target Realm becomes known.</p>

    <p class="example"><code data-x="dom-MessagePort-postMessage">messagePort.postMessage()</code>
    uses this pair of abstract operations, as the destination Realm is not known until the
    <code>MessagePort</code> <span>has been shipped</span>.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><span>StructuredSerialize</span></dt>
   <dt><span>StructuredSerializeForStorage</span></dt>
   <dt><span>StructuredDeserialize</span></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Creating a <span>JavaScript Realm</span>-independent snapshot of a given value which can be
    saved for an indefinite amount of time, and then reified back into a JavaScript value later,
    possibly multiple times.</p>

    <p><span>StructuredSerializeForStorage</span> can be used for situations where the serialization
    is anticipated to be stored in a persistent manner, instead of passed between Realms. It throws
    when attempting to serialize <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> objects, since storing shared memory
    does not make sense. Similarly, it can throw or possibly have different behavior when given a
    <span>platform object</span> with custom <span>serialization steps</span> when the
    <var>forStorage</var> argument is true.</p>

    <p class="example"><code data-x="dom-history-pushState">history.pushState()</code> and <code
    data-x="dom-history-replaceState">history.replaceState()</code> use
    <span>StructuredSerializeForStorage</span> on author-supplied state objects, storing them as
    <span>serialized state</span> in the appropriate <span>session history entry</span>. Then,
    <span>StructuredDeserialize</span> is used so that the <code
    data-x="dom-history-state">history.state</code> property can return a clone of the
    originally-supplied state object.</p>

    <p class="example"><code
    data-x="dom-BroadcastChannel-postMessage">broadcastChannel.postMessage()</code> uses
    <span>StructuredSerialize</span> on its input, then uses <span>StructuredDeserialize</span>
    multiple times on the result to produce a fresh clone for each destination being broadcast
    to. Note that transferring does not make sense in multi-destination situations.</p>

    <p class="example">Any API for persisting JavaScript values to the filesystem would also use
    <span>StructuredSerializeForStorage</span> on its input and <span>StructuredDeserialize</span>
    on its output.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>In general, call sites may pass in Web IDL values instead of JavaScript values; this is to be
  understood to perform an implicit <span data-x="concept-idl-convert">conversion</span> to the
  JavaScript value before invoking these algorithms.</p>

  <p class="note" id="structuredclone"><span id="structured-clone"></span>This specification used
  to define a "structured clone" algorithm, and more recently a StructuredClone abstract operation.
  However, in practice all known uses of it were better served by separate serialization and
  deserialization steps, so it was removed.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Call sites that are not invoked as a result of author code synchronously calling into a user
  agent method must take care to properly <span>prepare to run script</span> and <span>prepare to
  run a callback</span> before invoking <span>StructuredSerialize</span>,
  <span>StructuredSerializeForStorage</span>, or <span>StructuredSerializeWithTransfer</span>
  abstract operations, if they are being performed on arbitrary objects. This is necessary because
  the serialization process can invoke author-defined accessors as part of its final
  deep-serialization steps, and these accessors could call into operations that rely on the <span
  data-x="concept-entry-everything">entry</span> and <span
  data-x="concept-incumbent-everything">incumbent</span> concepts being properly set up.</p>

  <p class="example"><code data-x="dom-window-postMessage">window.postMessage()</code> performs
  <span>StructuredSerializeWithTransfer</span> on its arguments, but is careful to do so
  immediately, inside the synchronous portion of its algorithm. Thus it is able to use the
  algorithms without needing to <span>prepare to run script</span> and <span>prepare to run a
  callback</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">In contrast, a hypothetical API that used <span>StructuredSerialize</span> to
  serialize some author-supplied object periodically, directly from a <span
  data-x="concept-task">task</span> on the <span>event loop</span>, would need to ensure it performs
  the appropriate preparations beforehand. As of this time, we know of no such APIs on the platform;
  usually it is simpler to perform the serialization ahead of time, as a synchronous consequence of
  author code.</p>
