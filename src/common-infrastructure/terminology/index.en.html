  <h3>Terminology</h3>

  <p>This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and IDL attributes, often in the same
  context. When it is not clear which is being referred to, they are referred to as <dfn
  data-x="">content attributes</dfn> for HTML and XML attributes, and <dfn data-x="">IDL
  attributes</dfn> for those defined on IDL interfaces. Similarly, the term "properties" is used for
  both JavaScript object properties and CSS properties. When these are ambiguous they are qualified
  as <dfn data-x="">object properties</dfn> and <dfn data-x="">CSS properties</dfn> respectively.</p>

  <p>Generally, when the specification states that a feature applies to <span>the HTML syntax</span>
  or <span>the XML syntax</span>, it also includes the other. When a feature specifically only
  applies to one of the two languages, it is called out by explicitly stating that it does not apply
  to the other format, as in "for HTML, ... (this does not apply to XML)".</p>

  <p>This specification uses the term <dfn data-x="">document</dfn> to refer to any use of HTML,
  ranging from short static documents to long essays or reports with rich multimedia, as well as to
  fully-fledged interactive applications. The term is used to refer both to <code>Document</code>
  objects and their descendant DOM trees, and to serialized byte streams using the <span data-x="the
  HTML syntax">HTML syntax</span> or the <span data-x="the XML syntax">XML syntax</span>, depending
  on context.</p>

  <p>In the context of the DOM structures, the terms <span data-x="HTML documents">HTML
  document</span> and <span data-x="XML documents">XML document</span> are used as defined in the DOM
  specification, and refer specifically to two different modes that <code>Document</code> objects
  can find themselves in. <ref spec=DOM> (Such uses are always hyperlinked to their
  definition.)</p>

  <p>In the context of byte streams, the term HTML document refers to resources labeled as
  <code>text/html</code>, and the term XML document refers to resources labeled with an <span>XML
  MIME type</span>.</p>

  <p>For simplicity, terms such as <dfn data-x="">shown</dfn>, <dfn data-x="">displayed</dfn>, and
  <dfn data-x="">visible</dfn> might sometimes be used when referring to the way a document is
  rendered to the user. These terms are not meant to imply a visual medium; they must be considered
  to apply to other media in equivalent ways.</p>
