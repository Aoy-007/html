  <h4>Parallelism</h4>

  <p>To run steps <dfn data-export="">in parallel</dfn> means those steps are to be run, one after
  another, at the same time as other logic in the standard (e.g., at the same time as the
  <span>event loop</span>). This standard does not define the precise mechanism by which this is
  achieved, be it time-sharing cooperative multitasking, fibers, threads, processes, using different
  hyperthreads, cores, CPUs, machines, etc. By contrast, an operation that is to run
  <dfn>immediately</dfn> must interrupt the currently running task, run itself, and then resume the
  previously running task.</p>

  <p>To avoid race conditions between different <span>in parallel</span> algorithms that operate on
  the same data, a <span>parallel queue</span> can be used.</p>

  <p>A <dfn data-export="">parallel queue</dfn> represents a queue of algorithm steps that must be
  run in series.</p>

  <p>A <span>parallel queue</span> has an <dfn>algorithm queue</dfn> (a <span>queue</span>),
  initially empty.</p>

  <p>To <dfn data-x="enqueue the following steps" data-lt="enqueue steps|enqueue the following
  steps" data-export="" data-dfn-for="parallel queue">enqueue steps</dfn> to a <span>parallel
  queue</span>, <span>enqueue</span> the algorithm steps to the <span>parallel queue</span>'s
  <span>algorithm queue</span>.</p>

  <p>To <dfn data-x="starting a new parallel queue" data-lt="start a new parallel queue|starting a
  new parallel queue" data-export="">start a new parallel queue</dfn>, run the following steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>parallelQueue</var> be a new <span>parallel queue</span>.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>Run the following steps <span>in parallel</span>:</p>

    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>While true:</p>

      <ol>
       <li><p>Let <var>steps</var> be the result of <span data-x="dequeue">dequeueing</span> from
       <var>parallelQueue</var>'s <span>algorithm queue</span>.</p></li>

       <li><p>If <var>steps</var> is not nothing, then run <var>steps</var>.</p></li>

       <li><p>Assert: running <var>steps</var> did not throw an exception, as steps running <span>in
       parallel</span> are not allowed to throw.</p></li>
      </ol>

      <p class="note">Implementations are not expected to implement this as a continuously running
      loop. Algorithms in standards are to be easy to understand and are not necessarily great for
      battery life or performance.</p>
     </li>
    </ol>
   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var>parallelQueue</var>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p class="note">Steps running <span>in parallel</span> can themselves run other steps in <span>in
  parallel</span>. E.g., inside a <span>parallel queue</span> it can be useful to run a series of
  steps in parallel with the queue.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Imagine a standard defined <var>nameList</var> (a <span>list</span>), along with a method to
   add a <var>name</var> to <var>nameList</var>, unless <var>nameList</var> already <span
   data-x="list contains">contains</span> <var>name</var>, in which case it rejects.</p>

   <p>The following solution suffers from race conditions:</p>

   <ol>
    <li><p>Let <var>p</var> be a new promise.</p></li>

    <li>
     <p>Run the following steps <span>in parallel</span>:</p>

     <ol>
      <li><p>If <var>nameList</var> <span data-x="list contains">contains</span> <var>name</var>,
      reject <var>p</var> with a <code>TypeError</code> and abort these steps.</p></li>

      <li><p>Do some potentially lengthy work.</p></li>

      <li><p><span data-x="list append">Append</span> <var>name</var> to
      <var>nameList</var>.</p></li>

      <li><p>Resolve <var>p</var> with undefined.</p></li>
     </ol>
    </li>

    <li><p>Return <var>p</var>.</p></li>
   </ol>

   <p>Two invocations of the above could run simultaneously, meaning <var>name</var> isn't in
   <var>nameList</var> during step 2.1, but it <em>might be added</em> before step 2.3 runs,
   meaning <var>name</var> ends up in <var>nameList</var> twice.</p>

   <p>Parallel queues solve this. The standard would let <var>nameListQueue</var> be the result of
   <span>starting a new parallel queue</span>, then:</p>

   <ol>
    <li><p>Let <var>p</var> be a new promise.</p></li>

    <li>
     <p><mark><span>Enqueue the following steps</span> to <var>nameListQueue</var>:</mark></p>

     <ol>
      <li><p>If <var>nameList</var> <span data-x="list contains">contains</span> <var>name</var>,
      reject <var>p</var> with a <code>TypeError</code> and abort these steps.</p></li>

      <li><p>Do some potentially lengthy work.</p></li>

      <li><p><span data-x="list append">Append</span> <var>name</var> to
      <var>nameList</var>.</p></li>

      <li><p>Resolve <var>p</var> with undefined.</p></li>
     </ol>
    </li>

    <li><p>Return <var>p</var>.</p></li>
   </ol>

   <p>The steps would now queue and the race is avoided.</p>
