  <h4 id="encoding-terminology">Character encodings</h4>

  <p>A <dfn data-x="encoding" data-x-href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoding">character
  encoding</dfn>, or just <i>encoding</i> where that is not ambiguous, is a defined way to convert
  between byte streams and Unicode strings, as defined in the WHATWG Encoding standard. An
  <span>encoding</span> has an <dfn data-x-href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#name">encoding
  name</dfn> and one or more <dfn data-x="encoding label"
  data-x-href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#label">encoding labels</dfn>, referred to as the
  encoding's <i>name</i> and <i>labels</i> in the Encoding standard. <ref spec=ENCODING></p>

  <p>A <dfn>UTF-16 encoding</dfn> is <span>UTF-16BE</span> or <span>UTF-16LE</span>. <ref
  spec=ENCODING></p>

  <p>An <dfn>ASCII-compatible encoding</dfn> is any <span>encoding</span> that is not a
  <span>UTF-16 encoding</span>. <ref spec=ENCODING></p>

  <p class="note">Since support for encodings that are not defined in the WHATWG Encoding standard
  is prohibited, <span data-x="UTF-16 encoding">UTF-16 encodings</span> are the only encodings that
  this specification needs to treat as not being <span
  data-x="ASCII-compatible encoding">ASCII-compatible encodings</span>.
