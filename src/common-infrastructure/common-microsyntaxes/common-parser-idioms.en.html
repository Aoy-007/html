  <h4>Common parser idioms</h4>

  </div>

  <p>The <dfn data-x="White_Space">White_Space characters</dfn> are those that have the Unicode
  property "White_Space" in the Unicode <code data-x="">PropList.txt</code> data file. <ref spec=UNICODE></p>

  <p class="note">This is not to be confused with the "White_Space" value (abbreviated "WS") of the
  "Bidi_Class" property in the <code data-x="">Unicode.txt</code> data file.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>control characters</dfn> are those whose Unicode "General_Category" property has the
  value "Cc" in the Unicode <code data-x="">UnicodeData.txt</code> data file. <ref spec=UNICODE></p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>Some of the micro-parsers described below follow the pattern of having an <var>input</var>
  variable that holds the string being parsed, and having a <var>position</var> variable pointing at
  the next character to parse in <var>input</var>.</p>
