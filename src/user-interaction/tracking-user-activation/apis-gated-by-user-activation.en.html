  <h4 id="user-activation-gated-apis">APIs gated by user activation</h4>

  </div>

  <p>APIs that are dependent on user activation are classified into three different levels. The
  levels are as follows, sorted by their "strength of dependence" on user activation (from weakest
  to strongest):</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn data-x="sticky activation gated api">Sticky activation-gated APIs</dfn></dt>
   <dd><p>These APIs require the <span>sticky activation</span> state to be true, so they are blocked
   until the very first user activation.</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="transient activation gated api">Transient activation-gated APIs</dfn><dt>
   <dd><p>These APIs require the <span>transient activation</span> state to be true, but they don't
   <span data-x="consume user activation">consume</span> it, so multiple calls are allowed per user
   activation until the transient state <span data-x="activation-expiry">expires</span>.</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn data-x="activation consuming api">Transient activation-consuming APIs</dfn></dt>
   <dd><p>These APIs require the <span>transient activation</span> state to be true, and they
   <span>consume user activation</span> in each call to prevent multiple calls per user
   activation.</p></dd>
