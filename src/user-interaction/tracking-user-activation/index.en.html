  <h3>Tracking user activation</h3>

  <p>To prevent abuse of certain APIs that could be annoying to users (e.g., opening popups or
  vibrating phones), user agents allow these APIs only when the user is actively interacting with
  the web page or has interacted with the page at least once. This "active interaction" state is
  maintained through the mechanisms defined in this section.</p>
