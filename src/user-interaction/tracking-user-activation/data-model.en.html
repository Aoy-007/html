  <h4 id="user-activation-data-model">Data model</h4>

  <p>For the purpose of tracking user activation, each <code>Window</code> <var>W</var> has a
  <dfn>last activation timestamp</dfn>. This is a number indicating the last time <var>W</var> got
  an <span>activation notification</span>. It corresponds to a
  <span><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></span> value except for two cases: positive infinity
  indicates that <var>W</var> has never been activated, while negative infinity indicates that a <a
  href="#user-activation-gated-apis">user activation-gated API</a> has <span data-x="consume user
  activation">consumed</span> the last user activation of <var>W</var>. The initial value is
  positive infinity.</p>

  <p>A user agent also defines a <dfn>transient activation duration</dfn>, which is a constant
  number indicating how long a user activation is available for certain <a
  href="#user-activation-gated-apis">user activation-gated APIs</a> (e.g., for opening popups).</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>transient activation duration</span> is expected be at most a few
  seconds, so that the user can possibly perceive the link between an interaction with the page and
  the page calling the activation-gated API.</p>

  <p>These two values imply two boolean user activation states for <var>W</var>:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn export>Sticky activation</dfn></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>When the <span>current high resolution time</span> is greater than or equal to the <span>last
    activation timestamp</span> in <var>W</var>, <var>W</var> is said to have <span>sticky
    activation</span>.</p>

    <p>This is <var>W</var>'s historical activation state, indicating whether the user has ever
    interacted in <var>W</var>. It starts false, then changes to true (and never changes back to
    false) when <var>W</var> gets the very first <span>activation notification</span>.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><dfn export>Transient activation</dfn></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>When the <span>current high resolution time</span> is greater than or equal to the <span>last
    activation timestamp</span> in <var>W</var>, and less than the <span>last activation
    timestamp</span> in <var>W</var> plus the <span>transient activation duration</span>, then
    <var>W</var> is said to have <span>transient activation</span>.</p>

    <p>This is <var>W</var>'s current activation state, indicating whether the user has interacted
    in <var>W</var> recently. This starts with a false value, and remains true for a limited time
    after every <span>activation notification</span> <var>W</var> gets.</p>

    <p>The <span>transient activation</span> state is considered <dfn
    data-x="activation-expiry">expired</dfn> if it becomes false because the <span>transient
    activation duration</span> time has elapsed since the last user activation. Note that it can
    become false even before the expiry time through an <span data-x="consume user
    activation">activation consumption</span>.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>
