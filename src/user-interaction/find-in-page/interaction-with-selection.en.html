  <h4>Interaction with selection</h4>

  <p>The find-in-page process is invoked in the context of a document, and may have an effect on
  the <span data-x="document-selection">selection</span> of that document. Specifically, the range
  that defines the <span data-x="fip-active-match">active match</span> can dictate the current
  selection. These selection updates, however, can happen at different times during the
  find-in-page process (e.g. upon the <span>find-in-page interface</span> dismissal or upon a change
  in the <span data-x="fip-active-match">active match</span> range).
