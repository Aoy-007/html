  <h4>Input modalities: the <code data-x="attr-enterkeyhint">enterkeyhint</code>
  attribute</h4>

  <p>User agents can support the <code data-x="attr-enterkeyhint">enterkeyhint</code>
  attribute on form controls (such as the value of <code>textarea</code> elements), or in elements
  in an <span>editing host</span> (e.g., using <code
  data-x="attr-contenteditable">contenteditable</code>).</p>

  <p>The <dfn element-attr for="html-global"><code
  data-x="attr-enterkeyhint">enterkeyhint</code></dfn> content attribute is an <span>enumerated
  attribute</span> that specifies what action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on
  virtual keyboards. This allows authors to customize the presentation of the enter key in order to
  make it more helpful for users.</p>

    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="html-global/enterkeyhint"><code
     data-x="attr-enterkeyhint-keyword-enter">enter</code></dfn>

     <td>The user agent should present a cue for the operation 'enter', typically
     inserting a new line.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="html-global/enterkeyhint"><code
     data-x="attr-enterkeyhint-keyword-done">done</code></dfn>

     <td>The user agent should present a cue for the operation 'done', typically
     meaning there is nothing more to input and the input method editor (IME)
     will be closed.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="html-global/enterkeyhint"><code
     data-x="attr-enterkeyhint-keyword-go">go</code></dfn>

     <td> The user agent should present a cue for the operation 'go', typically
     meaning to take the user to the target of the text they typed.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="html-global/enterkeyhint"><code
     data-x="attr-enterkeyhint-keyword-next">next</code></dfn>

     <td>The user agent should present a cue for the operation 'next', typically
     taking the user to the next field that will accept text.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="html-global/enterkeyhint"><code
     data-x="attr-enterkeyhint-keyword-previous">previous</code></dfn>

     <td>The user agent should present a cue for the operation 'previous', typically
     taking the user to the previous field that will accept text.
    <tr>
     <td><dfn attr-value for="html-global/enterkeyhint"><code
     data-x="attr-enterkeyhint-keyword-search">search</code></dfn>

     <td>The user agent should present a cue for the operation 'search', typically
     taking the user to the results of searching for the text they have typed.

     <td><dfn attr-value for="html-global/enterkeyhint"><code
     data-x="attr-enterkeyhint-keyword-send">send</code></dfn>

     <td> The user agent should present a cue for the operation 'send', typically
     delivering the text to its target.

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn attribute for="ElementContentEditable"><code
  data-x="dom-enterKeyHint">enterKeyHint</code></dfn> IDL attribute must <span>reflect</span> the
  <code data-x="attr-enterkeyhint">enterkeyhint</code> content attribute, <span>limited to only
  known values</span>.</p>

  <p>When <code data-x="attr-enterkeyhint">enterkeyhint</code> is unspecified (or is in a state not
  supported by the user agent), the user agent should determine the default action label (or icon)
  to present. Contextual information such as the <code data-x="attr-inputmode">inputmode</code>,
  <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code>, or <code data-x="attr-input-pattern">pattern</code>
  attributes should be used to determine which action label (or icon) to present on the virtual
  keyboard.</p>
