  <h4>The <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute</h4>

  <p>The <dfn element-attr for="htmlsvg-global"><code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code></dfn>
  content attribute allows authors to make an element and regions that have the element as its
  <span>DOM anchor</span> be <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span>, allow or prevent
  them from being <span>sequentially focusable</span>, and determine their relative ordering for
  <span>sequential focus navigation</span>.</p>

  <p>The name "tab index" comes from the common use of the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to navigate through
  the focusable elements. The term "tabbing" refers to moving forward through <span>sequentially
  focusable</span> <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span>.</p>

  <p>The <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute, if specified, must have a value
  that is a <span>valid integer</span>. Positive numbers specify the relative position of the
  element's <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> in the <span>sequential focus
  navigation order</span>, and negative numbers indicate that the control is not
  <span>sequentially focusable</span>.</p>

  <p>Developers should use caution when using values other than 0 or &#x2212;1 for their <code
  data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attributes as this is complicated to do correctly.</p>

  <div class="note">
   <p>The following provides a <span w-nodev>non-normative</span> summary of the behaviors of the
   possible <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute values.<span w-nodev> The below
   processing model gives the more precise rules.</span></p>

   <dl>
    <dt>omitted (or non-integer values)</dt>
    <dd>The user agent will decide whether the element is <span>focusable</span>, and if it is,
    whether it is <span>sequentially focusable</span> or <span>click focusable</span> (or both).</dd>

    <dt>&#x2212;1 (or other negative integer values)</dt>
    <dd>Causes the element to be <span>focusable</span>, and indicates that the author would prefer
    the element to be <span>click focusable</span> but not <span>sequentially focusable</span>. The
    user agent might ignore this preference for click and sequential focusability, e.g., for
    specific element types according to platform conventions, or for keyboard-only users.</dd>

    <dt>0</dt>
    <dd>Causes the element to be <span>focusable</span>, and indicates that the author would prefer
    the element to be both <span>click focusable</span> and <span>sequentially focusable</span>. The
    user agent might ignore this preference for click and sequential focusabiity.</dd>

    <dt>positive integer values</dt>
    <dd>Behaves the same as 0, but in addition creates a relative ordering within a
    <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span>, so that elements with higher <code
    data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute value come later.</dd>
   </dl>

   <p>Note that the <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute cannot be used to make
   an element non-focusable. The only way a page author can do that is by <span
   data-x="concept-element-disabled">disabling</span> the element, or making it
   <span>inert</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>tabindex value</dfn> of an element is the value of its <code
  data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> attribute, parsed using the <span>rules for parsing
  integers</span>. If parsing fails or the attribute is not specified, then the <span>tabindex
  value</span> is null.</p>

  <p>The <span>tabindex value</span> of a <span>focusable area</span> is the <span>tabindex
  value</span> of its <span>DOM anchor</span>.</p>

  <p>The <span>tabindex value</span> of an element must be interpreted as follows:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>If the value is null</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>The user agent should follow platform conventions to determine if the element should be
    considered as a <span>focusable area</span> and if so, whether the element and any <span
    data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> that have the element as their
    <span>DOM anchor</span> are <span>sequentially focusable</span>, and if so, what their relative
    position in their <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span> is to be. If the element
    is a <span>focus navigation scope owner</span>, it must be included in its
    <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span> even if it is not a <span>focusable
    area</span>.</p>

    <p>The relative ordering within a <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span> for
    elements and <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> that belong to the same
    <span>focus navigation scope</span> and whose <span>tabindex value</span> is null should be in
    <span>shadow-including tree order</span>.</p>

    <p>Modulo platform conventions, it is suggested that the following elements should be considered
    as <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> and be <span>sequentially
    focusable</span>:</p>

    <ul>
     <li><code>a</code> elements that have an <code data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code>
     attribute</li>

     <li><code>link</code> elements that have an <code
     data-x="attr-link-href">href</code> attribute</li>

     <li><code>button</code> elements</li>

     <li><code>input</code> elements whose <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute are
     not in the <span data-x="attr-input-type-hidden">Hidden</span> state</li>

     <li><code>select</code> elements</li>

     <li><code>textarea</code> elements</li>

     <li><code>summary</code> elements that are the first <code>summary</code> element child of a
     <code>details</code> element</li>

     <li>Elements with a <code data-x="attr-draggable">draggable</code> attribute set, if that would
     enable the user agent to allow the user to begin drag operations for those elements without
     the use of a pointing device</li>

     <li><span data-x="editing host">Editing hosts</span></li>

     <li><span data-x="browsing context container">Browsing context containers</span></li>
    </ul>
   </dd>

   <dt id="negative-tabindex">If the value is a negative integer</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>The user agent must consider the element as a <span>focusable area</span>, but should omit
    the element from any <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span>.</p>

    <p class="note">One valid reason to ignore the requirement that sequential focus navigation not
    allow the author to lead to the element would be if the user's only mechanism for moving the
    focus is sequential focus navigation. For instance, a keyboard-only user would be unable to
    click on a text control with a negative <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code>, so that
    user's user agent would be well justified in allowing the user to tab to the control
    regardless.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>If the value is a zero</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>The user agent must allow the element to be considered as a <span>focusable area</span> and
    should allow the element and any <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> that have
    the element as their <span>DOM anchor</span> to be <span>sequentially focusable</span>.</p>

    <p>The relative ordering within a <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span> for

    relative to other elements and <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> that belong
    to the same <span>focus navigation scope</span>, they are:</p>

    <ul>

  <p>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-tabIndex">tabIndex</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <span>reflect</span> the value of the <code data-x="attr-tabindex">tabindex</code> content
  attribute. The default value is 0 if the element is an <code>a</code>, <code>area</code>,
  <code>button</code>, <code>frame</code>, <code>iframe</code>, <code>input</code>,
  <code>object</code>, <code>select</code>, <code>textarea</code>, or <span>SVG
  <code>a</code></span> element, or is a <code>summary</code> element that is a <span>summary for
  its parent details</span>. The default value is &#x2212;1 otherwise.</p>

  <p class="note">The varying default value based on element type is a historical artifact.</p>
