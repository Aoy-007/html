  <p>The <dfn>unfocusing steps</dfn> for an object <var>old focus target</var> that is

    <p>If <var>old focus target</var> is a <span>focusable area</span>, then let <var>new

    <p>Otherwise, let <var>new focus target</var> be null.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>If <var>new focus target</var> is not null, then run the <span>focusing
   steps</span> for <var>new focus target</var>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>When the <span>currently focused area of a top-level browsing context</span> is somehow
  unfocused without another element being explicitly focused in its stead, the user agent must
  <span>immediately</span> run the <span>unfocusing steps</span> for that object.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>unfocusing steps</span> do not always result in the focus changing, even
  when applied to the <span>currently focused area of a top-level browsing context</span>. For
  example, if the <span>currently focused area of a top-level browsing context</span> is a
  <span>viewport</span>, then it will usually keep its focus regardless until another
  <span>focusable area</span> is explicitly focused with the <span>focusing steps</span>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><dfn>Focus fixup rule</dfn>: When the designated <span data-x="focused area of the
  document">focused area of the document</span> is removed from that <code>Document</code> in some
  way (e.g. it stops being a <span>focusable area</span>, it is removed from the DOM, it becomes
  <span>expressly inert</span>, etc.), designate the <code>Document</code>'s <span>viewport</span>
  to be the new <span>focused area of the document</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, this might happen because an element is removed from its
  <code>Document</code>, or has a <code data-x="attr-hidden">hidden</code> attribute added. It might
  also happen to an <code>input</code> element when the element gets <span
  data-x="concept-fe-disabled">disabled</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">In a <code>Document</code> whose <span data-x="focused area of the
  document">focused area</span> is a <code>button</code> element, removing, disabling, or hiding
  that button would cause the page's new <span data-x="focused area of the document">focused
  area</span> to be the <span>viewport</span> of the <code>Document</code>. This would, in turn,
  be reflected through the <code
  data-x="dom-documentorshadowroot-activeElement">activeElement</code> API as <span>the body
  element</span>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>focus update steps</dfn>, given an <var>old chain</var>, a <var>new chain</var>, and a <var>new focus target</var> respectively, are as

   and the last entry from <var>new chain</var> and redo this step.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>For each entry <var>entry</var> in <var>old chain</var>, in order, run

      <p class="note">In some cases, e.g. if <var>entry</var> is an <code>area</code>
