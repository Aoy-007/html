  <h4>Data model</h4>

  <p>The term <dfn>focusable area</dfn> is used to refer to regions of the interface that can become
  the target of keyboard input. Focusable areas can be elements, parts of elements, or other regions
  managed by the user agent.</p>

  <p>Each <span>focusable area</span> has a <dfn>DOM anchor</dfn>, which is a <code>Node</code> object
  that represents the position of the <span>focusable area</span> in the DOM. (When the <span>focusable
  area</span> is itself a <code>Node</code>, it is its own <span>DOM anchor</span>.) The <span>DOM anchor</span> is
  used in some APIs as a substitute for the <span>focusable area</span> when there is no other DOM object
  to represent the <span>focusable area</span>.</p>

  <p>The following table describes what objects can be <span data-x="focusable area">focusable
  areas</span>. The cells in the left column describe objects that can be <span data-x="focusable
  area">focusable areas</span>; the cells in the right column describe the <span data-x="DOM anchor">DOM
  anchors</span> for those elements. (The cells that span both columns are non-normative examples.)</p>

   </li>
  </ol>

  <p>All elements that are <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> are said to be
  <dfn>focusable</dfn>.</p>

  <p>There are two special types of focusability for <span data-x="focusable area">focusable
  areas</span>:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>A <span>focusable area</span> is said to be <dfn>sequentially focusable</dfn> if it is
    included in its <code>Document</code>'s <span>sequential focus navigation order</span> and
    the user agent determines that it is sequentially focusable.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>A <span>focusable area</span> is said to be <dfn>click focusable</dfn> if the user agent
    determines that it is click focusable. User agents should consider focusable areas with non-null
    <span data-x="tabindex value">tabindex values</span> to be click focusable.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Elements which are not <span>focusable</span> are not <span data-x="focusable
  area">focusable areas</span>, and thus not <span>sequentially focusable</span> and not <span>click
  focusable</span>.</p>

  <div class="note">
   <p>Being <span>focusable</span> is a statement about whether an element can be focused
   programmatically, e.g. via the <code data-x="dom-focus">focus()</code> method or <code
   data-x="attr-fe-autofocus">autofocus</code> attribute. In contrast, <span>sequentially
   focusable</span> and <span>click focusable</span> govern how the user agent responds to user
   interaction: respectively, to <span>sequential focus navigation</span> and as <a
   href="#focus-activation-behavior">activation behavior</a>.</p>

   <p>The user agent might determine that an element is not <span>sequentially focusable</span> even
   if it is <span>focusable</span> and is included in its <code>Document</code>'s <span>sequential
   focus navigation order</span>, according to user preferences. For example, macOS users can set
   the user agent to skip non-form control elements, or can skip links when doing <span>sequential
   focus navigation</span> with just the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key (as opposed to using both the
   <kbd>Option</kbd> and <kbd>Tab</kbd> keys).</p>

   <p>Similarly, the user agent might determine that an element is not <span>click focusable</span>
   even if it is <span>focusable</span>. For example, in some user agents, clicking on a
   non-editable form control does not focus it, i.e. the user agent has determined that such
   controls are not click focusable.</p>

   <p>Thus, an element can be <span>focusable</span>, but neither <span>sequentially
   focusable</span> nor <span>click focusable</span>. For example, in some user agents, a
   non-editable form-control with a negative-integer <span>tabindex value</span> would not be
   focusable via user interaction, only via programmatic APIs.</p>
  </div>

  <p>When a user <a href="#activation">activates</a> a <span>click focusable</span> <span>focusable
  area</span>, the user agent must run the <span>focusing steps</span> on the <span>focusable
  area</span> with <var>focus trigger</var> set to "<code data-x="">click</code>".</p>

  <p class="note">Note that focusing is not an <span>activation behavior</span>, i.e. calling the
  <code data-x="dom-click">click()</code> method on an element or dispatching a synthetic <code
  data-x="event-click">click</code> event on it won't cause the element to get focused.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>A node is a <dfn>focus navigation scope owner</dfn> if it is a <span>document</span>, a
  <span>shadow host</span> or a <span>slot</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <span>focus navigation scope owner</span> has a <dfn>focus navigation scope</dfn>, which
  is a list of elements. Its contents are determined as follows:</p>

  <p>Every element <var>element</var> has an <dfn>associated focus navigation owner</dfn>, which is
  either null or a <span>focus navigation scope owner</span>. It is determined by the following
  algorithm:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If <var>element</var>'s parent is null, then return null.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>element</var>'s parent is a <span>shadow host</span>, then return
   <var>element</var>'s <span>assigned slot</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>element</var>'s parent is a <span>shadow root</span>, then return the parent's
   <span data-x="concept-DocumentFragment-host">host</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>element</var>'s parent is the <span>document element</span>, then return the
   parent's <span>node document</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return <var>element</var>'s parent's <span>associated focus navigation owner</span>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Then, the contents of a given <span>focus navigation scope owner</span> <var>owner</var>'s
  <span>focus navigation scope</span> are all elements whose <span>associated focus navigation
  owner</span> is <var>owner</var>.</p>

  <p class="note">The order of elements within a <span>focus navigation scope</span> does not impact
  any of the algorithms in this specification. Ordering only becomes important for the
  <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span> and <span>flattened tabindex-ordered focus
  navigation scope</span> concepts defined below.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</dfn> is a list of <span data-x="focusable
  area">focusable areas</span> and <span data-x="focus navigation scope owner">focus navigation
  scope owners</span>. Every <span>focus navigation scope owner</span> <var>owner</var> has
  <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span>, whose contents are determined as
  follows:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>It contains all elements in <var>owner</var>'s <span>focus navigation scope</span> that
   are themselves <span data-x="focus navigation scope owner">focus navigation scope owners</span>,
   except the elements whose <span>tabindex value</span> is a negative integer.</p></li>

   <li><p>It contains all of the <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> whose
   <span>DOM anchor</span> is an element in <var>owner</var>'s <span>focus navigation scope</span>,
   except the <span data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span> whose <span>tabindex value</span>
   is a negative integer.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The order within a <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span> is determined by each
  element's <span>tabindex value</span>, as described in the section below.</p>

  <p class="note">The rules there do not give a precise ordering, as they are composed mostly of
  "<!--non-normative-->should" statements and relative orderings.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>flattened tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</dfn> is a list of <span
  data-x="focusable area">focusable areas</span>. Every <span>focus navigation scope owner</span>
  <var>owner</var> owns a distinct <span>flattened tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span>,
  whose contents are determined by the following algorithm:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>result</var> be a <span data-x="list clone">clone</span> of <var>owner</var>'s
   <span>tabindex-ordered focus navigation scope</span>.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>For each <var>item</var> of <var>result</var>:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>If <var>item</var> is not a <span>focus navigation scope owner</span>, then
     <span>continue</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>item</var> is not a <span>focusable area</span>, then replace <var>item</var>
     with all of the items in <var>item</var>'s <span>flattened tabindex-ordered focus navigation
     scope</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Otherwise, insert the contents of <var>item</var>'s <span>flattened tabindex-ordered
     focus navigation scope</span> after <var>item</var>.</p></li>
    </ol>
   </li>
  </ol>
