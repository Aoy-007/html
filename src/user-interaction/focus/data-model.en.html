  <h4>Data model</h4>

  <p>The term <dfn>focusable area</dfn> is used to refer to regions of the interface that can become
  the target of keyboard input. Focusable areas can be elements, parts of elements, or other regions
  managed by the user agent.</p>

  <p>Each <span>focusable area</span> has a <dfn>DOM anchor</dfn>, which is a <code>Node</code> object
  that represents the position of the <span>focusable area</span> in the DOM. (When the <span>focusable
  area</span> is itself a <code>Node</code>, it is its own <span>DOM anchor</span>.) The <span>DOM anchor</span> is
  used in some APIs as a substitute for the <span>focusable area</span> when there is no other DOM object
  to represent the <span>focusable area</span>.</p>

  <p>The following table describes what objects can be <span data-x="focusable area">focusable
  areas</span>. The cells in the left column describe objects that can be <span data-x="focusable
  area">focusable areas</span>; the cells in the right column describe the <span data-x="DOM anchor">DOM
  anchors</span> for those elements. (The cells that span both columns are non-normative examples.)</p>
