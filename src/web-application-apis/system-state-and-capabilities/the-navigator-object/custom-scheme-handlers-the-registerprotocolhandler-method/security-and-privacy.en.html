  <h6>Security and privacy</h6>

  <p>Custom scheme handlers can introduce a number of concerns, in particular privacy concerns.</p>

  <p><strong>Hijacking all web usage.</strong> User agents should not allow schemes that are key to
  its normal operation, such as an <span>HTTP(S) scheme</span>, to be rerouted through third-party
  sites. This would allow a user's activities to be trivially tracked, and would allow user
  information, even in secure connections, to be collected.</p>

  <p><strong>Hijacking defaults.</strong> User agents are strongly urged to not automatically change
  any defaults, as this could lead the user to send data to remote hosts that the user is not
  expecting. New handlers registering themselves should never automatically cause those sites to be
  used.</p>

  <p><strong>Registration spamming.</strong> User agents should consider the possibility that a site
  will attempt to register a large number of handlers, possibly from multiple domains (e.g., by
  redirecting through a series of pages each on a different domain, and each registering a handler
  for <code data-x="">web+spam:</code> &mdash; analogous practices abusing other web browser
  features have been used by pornography web sites for many years). User agents should gracefully
  handle such hostile attempts, protecting the user.</p>

  <p><strong>Hostile handler metadata.</strong> User agents should protect against typical attacks
  against strings embedded in their interface, for example ensuring that markup or escape characters
  in such strings are not executed, that null bytes are properly handled, that over-long strings do
  not cause crashes or buffer overruns, and so forth.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking private data.</strong> Web page authors may reference a custom scheme
  handler using URL data considered private. They might do so with the expectation that the user's
  choice of handler points to a page inside the organization, ensuring that sensitive data will not
  be exposed to third parties. However, a user may have registered a handler pointing to an
  external site, resulting in a data leak to that third party. Implementors might wish to consider
  allowing administrators to disable custom handlers on certain subdomains, content types, or
  schemes.</p>

  <p><strong>Leaking credentials.</strong> User agents must never send username or password
  information in the URLs that are escaped and included sent to the handler sites. User agents may
  even avoid attempting to pass to web-based handlers the URLs of resources that are known to
  require authentication to access, as such sites would be unable to access the resources in
  question without prompting the user for credentials themselves (a practice that would require the
  user to know whether to trust the third-party handler, a decision many users are unable to make or
  even understand).</p>

  <p><strong>Interface interference.</strong> User agents should be prepared to handle intentionally
  long arguments to the methods. For example, if the user interface exposed consists of an "accept"
  button and a "deny" button, with the "accept" binding containing the name of the handler, it's
  important that a long name not cause the "deny" button to be pushed off the screen.</p>
