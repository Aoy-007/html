  <h5 id="event-loop-for-spec-authors">Dealing with the event loop from other specifications</h5>

  <p>Writing specifications that correctly interact with the <span>event loop</span> can be tricky.
  This is compounded by how this specification uses a concurrency-model-independent processing
  model, so we say things like "<span>event loop</span>" and "<span>in parallel</span>" instead of
  using more familiar model-specific terms like "main thread" or "on a background thread".</p>

  <p>The overriding guideline is that any work which would otherwise block the <span>event
  loop</span> must instead be performed <span>in parallel</span> with it. This includes (but is not
  limited to):</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>performing heavy computation;</p></li>

   <li><p>displaying a user-facing prompt;</p></li>

   <li><p>performing operations which could require involving outside systems (i.e. "going out of
   process").</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The next complication is that, in algorithm sections that are <span>in parallel</span>, you
  must not create or manipulate objects associated to a specific <span>JavaScript realm</span>,
  <span data-x="global object">global</span>, or <span>environment settings object</span>. (Stated
  in more familiar terms, you must not directly access main-thread artifacts from a background
  thread.) Doing so would create data races observable to JavaScript code, since after all, your
  algorithm steps are running <em><span>in parallel</span></em> to the JavaScript code.</p>

  <p>You can, however, manipulate specification-level data structures and values from the WHATWG
  Infra Standard, as those are realm-agnostic. They are never directly exposed to JavaScript without
  a specific conversion taking place (often <span data-x="concept-idl-convert">via Web IDL</span>).
  <ref spec=INFRA> <ref spec=WEBIDL></p>

  <p>To affect the world of observable JavaScript objects, then, you must <span>queue a task</span>
  to perform any such manipulations. This ensures your steps are properly interleaved with respect
  to other things happening on the <span>event loop</span>. Furthermore, you must choose a
  <span>task source</span> when <span data-x="queue a task">queueing a task</span>; this governs the
  relative order of your steps versus others. If you are unsure which <span>task source</span> to
  use, pick one of the <a href="#generic-task-sources">generic task sources</a> that sounds most
  applicable.</p>

  <p>Most invocations of <span>queue a task</span> implicitly use "the relevant <span>event
  loop</span>", i.e., the one that is obvious from context. That is because it is very rare for
  algorithms to be invoked in contexts involving multiple event loops. (Unlike contexts involving
  multiple global objects, which happen all the time!) So unless you are writing a specification
  which, e.g., deals with manipulating <a href="#workers">workers</a>, you can omit this argument
  when <span data-x="queue a task">queueing a task</span>.</p>

  <p>Putting this all together, we can provide a template for a typical algorithm that needs to do
  work asynchronously:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Do any synchronous setup work, while still on the <span>event loop</span>. This may
   include converting <span data-x="JavaScript realm">realm-specific</span> JavaScript values into
   realm-agnostic specification-level values.</p></li>

   <li><p>Perform a set of potentially-expensive steps <span>in parallel</span>, operating entirely on
   realm-agnostic values, and producing a realm-agnostic result.</p></li>

   <li><p><span>Queue a task</span>, on a specified <span>task source</span>, to convert the
   realm-agnostic result back into observable effects on the observable world of JavaScript objects
   on the <span>event loop</span>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <div class="example" id="example-event-loop-using-algorithm">

   <p>The following is an algorithm that "encrypts" a passed-in <span>list</span> of <span
   data-x="scalar value string">scalar value strings</span> <var>input</var>, after parsing them as
   URLs:</p>

   <ol>
    <li><p>Let <var>urls</var> be an empty <span>list</span>.</p></li>

    <li>
     <p><span data-x="list iterate">For each</span> <var>string</var> of <var>input</var>:</p>

     <ol>
      <li><p>Let <var>parsed</var> be the result of <span data-x="parse a URL">parsing</span>
      <var>string</var> relative to the <span>current settings object</span>.</p></li>

      <li><p>If <var>parsed</var> is failure, return a promise rejected with a
      <span>"<code>SyntaxError</code>"</span> <code>DOMException</code>.</p></li>

      <li><p>Let <var>serialized</var> be the result of applying the <span

      <li><p><span data-x="list append">Append</span> <var>serialized</var> to <var>urls</var>.</p></li>
     </ol>
    </li>

    <li><p>Let <var>realm</var> be the <span>current Realm Record</span>.</p></li>

    <li><p>Let <var>p</var> be a new promise.</p></li>

    <li>
     <p>Run the following steps <span>in parallel</span>:</p>

     <ol>
      <li><p>Let <var>encryptedURLs</var> be an empty <span>list</span>.</p></li>

      <li>
       <p><span data-x="list iterate">For each</span> <var>url</var> of <var>urls</var>:</p>

       <ol>
        <li><p>Wait 100 milliseconds, so that people think we're doing heavy-duty encryption.</p></li>

        <li><p>Let <var>encrypted</var> be a new <span>JavaScript string</span> derived from
        <var>url</var>, whose <var>n</var>th <span>code unit</span> is equal to <var>url</var>'s
        <var>n</var>th <span>code unit</span> plus 13.</p></li>

        <li><p><span data-x="list append">Append</span> <var>encrypted</var> to
        <var>encryptedURLs</var>.</p>
       </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
       <p><span>Queue a task</span>, on the <span>networking task source</span>, to perform the
       following steps:</p>

       <ol>
        <li><p>Let <var>array</var> be the result of <span
        data-x="concept-idl-convert">converting</span> <var>encryptedURLs</var> to a JavaScript
        array, in <var>realm</var>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Resolve <var>p</var> with <var>array</var>.</p></li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>

    <li><p>Return <var>p</var>.</p></li>
   </ol>

   <p>Here are several things to notice about this algorithm:</p>

   <ul>
    <li><p>It does its URL parsing up front, on the <span>event loop</span>, before going to the
    <span>in parallel</span> steps. This is necessary, since parsing depends on the <span>current
    settings object</span>, which would no longer be current after going <span>in
    parallel</span>.</p></li>

    <li><p>Alternately, it could have saved a reference to the <span>current settings
    object</span>'s <span>API base URL</span> and used it during the <span>in parallel</span> steps;
    that would have been equivalent. However, we recommend instead doing as much work as possible up
    front, as this example does. Attempting to save the correct values can be error prone; for
    example, if we'd saved just the <span>current settings object</span>, instead of its <span>API
    base URL</span>, there would have been a potential race.</p></li>

    <li><p>It implicitly passes a <span>list</span> of <span data-x="JavaScript string">JavaScript
    strings</span> from the initial steps to the <span>in parallel</span> steps. This is OK, as
    both <span data-x="list">lists</span> and <span data-x="JavaScript string">JavaScript
    strings</span> are <span data-x="JavaScript Realm">realm</span>-agnostic.</p></li>

    <li><p>It performs "expensive computation" (waiting for 100 milliseconds per input URL) during
    the <span>in parallel</span> steps, thus not blocking the main <span>event loop</span>.</p></li>

    <li><p>Promises, as observable JavaScript objects, are never created and manipulated during the
    <span>in parallel</span> steps. <var>p</var> is created before entering those steps, and then is
    manipulated during a <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> that is <span data-x="queue a
    task">queued</span> specifically for that purpose.</p></li>

    <li><p>The creation of a JavaScript array object also happens during the queued task, and is
    careful to specify which realm it creates the array in since that is no longer obvious from
    context.</p></li>
   </ul>

   <p>(On these last two points, see also <a
   href="https://github.com/w3ctag/promises-guide/issues/52">w3ctag/promises-guide#52</a>, <a
   href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/135">heycam/webidl#135</a>, and <a
   href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/371">heycam/webidl#371</a>, where we are still
   mulling over the subtleties of the above promise-resolution pattern.)</p>

   <p>Another thing to note is that, in the event this algorithm was called from a Web IDL-specified
   operation taking a <code data-x="">sequence</code>&lt;<code
   data-x="idl-USVString">USVString</code>>, there was an automatic conversion from <span
   data-x="JavaScript realm">realm</span>-specific JavaScript objects provided by the author as
   input, into the realm-agnostic <code data-x="">sequence</code>&lt;<code
   data-x="idl-USVString">USVString</code>> Web IDL type, which we then treat as a
   <span>list</span> of <span data-x="scalar value string">scalar value strings</span>. So depending
   on how your specification is structured, there may be other implicit steps happening on the main
   <span>event loop</span> that play a part in this whole process of getting you ready to go
   <span>in parallel</span>.</p>
