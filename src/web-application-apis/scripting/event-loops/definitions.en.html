  <h5 w-nodev>Definitions</h5>

  <p>To coordinate events, user interaction, scripts, rendering, networking, and so forth, user
  agents must use <dfn data-x="event loop" data-lt="event loop" export>event loops</dfn> as
  described in this section. Each <span>agent</span> has an associated <dfn export for="agent"
  data-x="concept-agent-event-loop">event loop</dfn>, which is unique to that agent.</p>

  <p>The <span data-x="concept-agent-event-loop">event loop</span> of a <span>similar-origin window
  agent</span> is known as a <dfn>window event loop</dfn>. The <span
  data-x="concept-agent-event-loop">event loop</span> of a <span>dedicated worker agent</span>,
  <span>shared worker agent</span>, or <span>service worker agent</span> is known as a <dfn>worker
  event loop</dfn>. And the <span data-x="concept-agent-event-loop">event loop</span> of a
  <span>worklet agent</span> is known as a <dfn>worklet event loop</dfn>.</p>

  <div class="note">
   <p><span data-x="event loop">Event loops</span> do not necessarily correspond to implementation
   threads. For example, multiple <span data-x="window event loop">window event loops</span> could
   be cooperatively scheduled in a single thread.</p>

   <p>However, for the various worker <span data-x="agent">agents</span> that are allocated with
   [[CanBlock]] set to true, the JavaScript specification does place requirements on them regarding
   <span>forward progress</span>, which effectively amount to requiring dedicated per-agent threads
   in those cases.</p>

  <p>An <span>event loop</span> has one or more <dfn data-x="task queue">task queues</dfn>. A
  <span>task queue</span> is a <span>set</span> of <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span>.</p>

  <p class="note"><span data-x="task queue">Task queues</span> are <span data-x="set">sets</span>,
  not <span data-x="queue">queues</span>, because <a href="#step1">step one of the event loop
  processing model</a> grabs the first <span data-x="concept-task-runnable"><em>runnable</em></span>
  <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> from the chosen queue, instead of <span
  data-x="dequeue">dequeuing</span> the first task.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>microtask queue</span> is not a <span>task queue</span>.</p>

  <p>Tasks encapsulate algorithms that are responsible for such work as:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>Events</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Dispatching an <code>Event</code> object at a particular
    <code>EventTarget</code> object is often done by a dedicated task.</p>

    <p class="note">Not all events are dispatched using the <span>task queue</span>; many are
    dispatched during other tasks.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Parsing</dt>
   <dd><p>The <span>HTML parser</span> tokenizing one or more bytes, and then processing any
   resulting tokens, is typically a task.</p></dd>

   <dt>Callbacks</dt>
   <dd><p>Calling a callback is often done by a dedicated task.</p></dd>


   <dt>Using a resource</dt>
   <dd><p>When an algorithm <span data-x="concept-fetch">fetches</span> a resource, if the fetching
   occurs in a non-blocking fashion then the processing of the resource once some or all of the
   resource is available is performed by a task.</p></dd>

   <dt>Reacting to DOM manipulation</dt>
   <dd><p>Some elements have tasks that trigger in response to DOM manipulation, e.g. when that
   element is <span data-x="node is inserted into a document">inserted into the document</span>.</p>
  </dl>

  <p>Formally, a <dfn data-x="concept-task" data-lt="task" export>task</dfn> is a
  <span>struct</span> which has:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn data-x="concept-task-steps">Steps</dfn></dt>
   <dd>A series of steps specifying the work to be done by the task.</dd>

   <dt>A <dfn data-x="concept-task-source">source</dfn></dt>
   <dd>One of the <span data-x="task source">task sources</span>, used to group and serialize
   related tasks.</dd>

   <dt>A <dfn data-x="concept-task-document">document</dfn></dt>
   <dd>A <code>Document</code> associated with the task, or null for tasks that are not in a
   <span>window event loop</span>.</dd>

   <dt>A <dfn export>script evaluation environment settings object set</dfn></dt>
   <dd>A <span>set</span> of <span data-x="environment settings object">environment settings
   objects</span> used for tracking script evaluation during the task.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>A <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> is <dfn data-x="concept-task-runnable">runnable</dfn>
  if its <span data-x="concept-task-document">document</span> is either null or <span>fully
  active</span>.</p>

  <p>Per its <span data-x="concept-task-source">source</span> field, each <span
  data-x="concept-task">task</span> is defined as coming from a specific <dfn export>task
  source</dfn>. For each <span>event loop</span>, every <span>task source</span> must be associated
  with a specific <span>task queue</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">Essentially, <span data-x="task source">task sources</span> are used within
  standards to separate logically-different types of tasks, which a user agent might wish to
  distinguish between. <span data-x="task queue">Task queues</span> are used by user agents to
  coalesce task sources within a given <span>event loop</span>.</p>

  <p class="example">For example, a user agent could have one <span>task queue</span> for mouse and
  key events (to which the <span>user interaction task source</span> is associated), and another to
  which all other <span data-x="task source">task sources</span> are associated. Then, using the
  freedom granted in the initial step of the <a href="#event-loop-processing-model">event loop
  processing model</a>, it could give keyboard and mouse events preference over other tasks
  three-quarters of the time, keeping the interface responsive but not starving other task queues.
  Note that in this setup, the processing model still enforces that the user agent would never
  process events from any one <span>task source</span> out of order.</p>

  <p>Each <span>event loop</span> has a <dfn>currently running task</dfn>, which is either a <span
  data-x="concept-task">task</span> or null. Initially, this is null. It is used to handle
  reentrancy.</p>

  <p>Each <span>event loop</span> has a <dfn>microtask queue</dfn>, which is a <span>queue</span> of
  <span data-x="microtask">microtasks</span>, initially empty. A <dfn export>microtask</dfn> is a
  colloquial way of referring to a <span data-x="concept-task">task</span> that was created via the
  <span>queue a microtask</span> algorithm.</p>

  <p>Each <span>event loop</span> has a <dfn>performing a microtask checkpoint</dfn> boolean,
  which is initially false. It is used to prevent reentrant invocation of the <span>perform a
  microtask checkpoint</span> algorithm.</p>
