  <h5>Integration with the JavaScript agent cluster formalism</h5>

  <p>JavaScript also defines the concept of an <span>agent cluster</span>, which this standard maps
  to the web platform using the <dfn>can share memory with</dfn> equivalence relation detailed
  below. On the web platform, an <span>agent cluster</span> consists of all <span
  data-x="agent">agents</span> in the same equivalence class with respect to the <span>can share
  memory with</span> equivalence relation.</p>

  <p>The <span>agent cluster</span> concept is crucial for defining the JavaScript memory model, and
  in particular among which <span data-x="agent">agents</span> the backing data of
  <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> objects can be shared.</p>

  <p class="note">Conceptually, the <span>agent cluster</span> concept is an
  architecture-independent, idealized "process boundary" that groups together multiple "threads"
  (<span data-x="agent">agents</span>). The <span data-x="agent cluster">agent clusters</span>
  defined by the specification are generally more restrictive than the actual process boundaries
  implemented in user agents. By enforcing these idealized divisions at the specification level, we
  ensure that web developers see interoperable behavior with regard to shared memory, even in the
  face of varying and changing user agent process models.</p>

  <p>A <span>similar-origin window agent</span>, <span>dedicated worker agent</span>, <span>shared
  worker agent</span>, or <span>service worker agent</span>, <var>agent</var>, <span>can share
  memory with</span> any <span>dedicated worker agent</span> whose single <span data-x="JavaScript
  realm">realm</span>'s <span data-x="concept-realm-global">global object</span>'s <span>owner
  set</span> contains an item whose <span data-x="concept-relevant-realm">relevant Realm</span>
  belongs to <var>agent</var>.</p>

  <p class="note">"Item" is used above as an <span>owner set</span> can contain
  <code>Document</code> objects.</p>

  <p class="&#x0058;&#x0058;&#x0058;">A <span>worklet agent</span> &hellip; currently worklets have
  no clearly defined owner, see: <a
  href="https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/issues/224">w3c/css-houdini-drafts issue
  #224</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition, any <span>agent</span> <var>A</var> <span>can share memory with</span>:</p>

  <ul class="brief">
   <li><var>A</var>,</li>

   <li>any <span>agent</span> <var>B</var> such that <var>B</var> <span>can share memory with</span>
   <var>A</var>, and</li>

   <li>any <span>agent</span> <var>B</var> such that there exists an <span>agent</span>
   <var>C</var>, where <var>A</var> <span>can share memory with</span> <var>C</var> and <var>C</var>
   <span>can share memory with</span> <var>B</var>.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following pairs of global objects are each within the same <span>agent cluster</span>, and
   thus can use <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> instances to share memory with each other:</p>

   <ul class="brief">
    <li>A <code>Window</code> object and a dedicated worker that it created.</li>

    <li>A worker (of any type) and a dedicated worker it created.</li>

    <li>A <code>Window</code> object <var>A</var> and the <code>Window</code> object of an
    <code>iframe</code> element that <var>A</var> created that could be <span>same
    origin-domain</span> with <var>A</var>.</li>

    <li>A <code>Window</code> object and a <span>same origin-domain</span> <code>Window</code>
    object that opened it.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>The following pairs of global objects are <em>not</em> within the same <span>agent
   cluster</span>, and thus cannot share memory:</p>

   <ul class="brief">
    <li>A <code>Window</code> object and a shared worker it created.</li>

    <li>A worker (of any type) and a shared worker it created.</li>

    <li>A <code>Window</code> object and a service worker it created.</li>

    <li>A <code>Window</code> object <var></var> and the <code>Window</code> object of an
    <code>iframe</code> element that <var>A</var> created that cannot be <span>same
    origin-domain</span> with <var>A</var>.</li>

    <li>Any two <code>Window</code> objects whose <span data-x="browsing context">browsing
    contexts</span> do not have an <span data-x="opener browsing context">opener</span> or <span
    data-x="ancestor browsing context">ancestor</span> relationship. This holds even if the two
    <code>Window</code> objects are <span>same origin</span>.</li>
   </ul>
