  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>To avoid exposing web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are
  designed such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even
  with <span data-x="Worker">workers</span>, the intent is that the behavior of implementations can
  be thought of as completely serializing the execution of all scripts in all <span data-x="browsing
  context">browsing contexts</span>.</p>

  <p>The exception to this general design principle is the JavaScript <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code>
  class. Using <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> objects, it can in fact be observed that scripts in
  other <span data-x="agent">agents</span> are executing simultaneously. Furthermore, due to the
  JavaScript memory model, there are situations which not only are un-representable via serialized
  <em>script</em> execution, but also un-representable via serialized <em>statement</em> execution
  among those scripts.</p>
