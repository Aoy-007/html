  <!-- NON-NORMATIVE SECTION -->

  <p>In short: Yes.</p>

  <p>In more length: the term "HTML5" is widely used as a buzzword to refer to modern web
  technologies, many of which (though by no means all) are developed at the WHATWG. This document is
  one such; others are available from <a href="https://spec.whatwg.org/">the WHATWG Standards
  overview</a>.</p>
