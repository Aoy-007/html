  <!--en-GB--><h4 id="the-input-element-as-a-colour-well">The <code>input</code> element as a color
  well</h4>

  <p>An <code>input</code> element whose <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
  the <span data-x="attr-input-type-color">Color</span> state is expected to depict a color well,
  which, when activated, provides the user with a color picker (e.g. a color wheel or color
  palette) from which the color can be changed. The element, when it generates a <span>CSS
  box</span>, is expected to use <span>button layout</span>, that has no child boxes of the
  <span>anonymous button content box</span>. The <span>anonymous button content box</span> is
  expected to have a <span data-x="presentational hints">presentational hint</span> setting the
  <span>'background-color'</span> property to the element's <span
  data-x="concept-fe-value">value</span>.</p>

  <p>Predefined suggested values (provided by the <code data-x="attr-input-list">list</code>
  attribute) are expected to be shown in the color picker interface, not on the color well
  itself.</p>
