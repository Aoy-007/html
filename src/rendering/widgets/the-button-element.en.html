  <h4>The <code>button</code> element</h4>

  <p>The <code>button</code> element, when it generates a <span>CSS box</span>, is expected to
  depict a button and to use <span>button layout</span> whose <span>anonymous button content
  box</span>'s contents (if there is an <span>anonymous button content box</span>) are the child
  boxes the element's box would otherwise have.</p>
