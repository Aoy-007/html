  <h4>The <code>input</code> element as a file upload control</h4>

  <p>An <code>input</code> element whose <code data-x="attr-input-type">type</code> attribute is in
  the <span data-x="attr-input-type-file">File Upload</span> state, when it generates a <span>CSS
  box</span>, is expected to render as an <span>'inline-block'</span> box containing a span of text
  giving the file name(s) of the <span data-x="concept-input-type-file-selected">selected
  files</span>, if any, followed by a button that, when activated, provides the user with a file
  picker from which the selection can be changed. The button is expected to use <span>button
  layout</span> and the contents of the <span>anonymous button content box</span> are expected to be
  <span>implementation-defined</span> (and possibly locale-specific) text, for example "Choose
  file".</p>
