  <h4>Garbage collection and browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> has a strong reference to each of its <code>Document</code>s
  and its <code>WindowProxy</code> object, and the user agent itself has a strong reference to its
  <span data-x="top-level browsing context">top-level browsing contexts</span>.</p>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> has a strong reference to its <code>Window</code> object.</p>

  <p class="note">A <code>Window</code> object <span data-x="implied strong reference">has a strong
  reference</span> to its <code>Document</code> object through its <code
  data-x="dom-document">document</code> attribute. Thus, references from other scripts to either of
  those objects will keep both alive. Similarly, both <code>Document</code> and <code>Window</code>
  objects have <span data-x="implied strong reference">implied strong references</span> to the
  <code>WindowProxy</code> object.</p>

  <p>Each <span data-x="concept-script">script</span> has a strong reference to its <span>settings
  object</span>, and each <span>environment settings object</span> has strong references to its
  <span data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global object</span>, <span>responsible browsing
  context</span>, and <span>responsible document</span> (if any).</p>

  <p>To <dfn data-export="" data-x="discard a document" data-lt="discard a document">discard</dfn> a
  <code>Document</code> <var>document</var>:</p>

  <ol>

   <li><p>Set <var>document</var>'s <i data-x="concept-document-salvageable">salvageable</i> state
   to false.</p></li>

   <li><p>Run any <span>unloading document cleanup steps</span> for <var>document</var> that
   are defined by this specification and <span>other applicable specifications</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span data-x="abort a document">Abort</span> <var>document</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Remove any <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> associated with
   <var>document</var> in any <span>task source</span>, without running those tasks.</p></li>

   <li><p><span data-x="a browsing context is discarded">Discard</span> all the <span data-x="child
   browsing context">child browsing contexts</span> of <var>document</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Lose the strong reference from <var>document</var>'s <span
   data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span> to <var>document</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p><span data-x="list remove">Remove</span> <var>document</var> from the
   <span>owner set</span> of each <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object whose set <span
   data-x="list contains">contains</span> <var>document</var>.</p></li>

  </ol>

  <p>When <dfn data-export="">a <em>browsing context</em> is discarded</dfn>, the strong reference
  from the user agent itself to the <span>browsing context</span> must be severed, and all the
  <code>Document</code> objects for all the entries in the <span>browsing context</span>'s session
  history must be <span data-x="discard a document">discarded</span> as well.</p>

  <p>User agents may <span data-x="a browsing context is discarded">discard</span> <span
  data-x="top-level browsing context">top-level browsing contexts</span> at any time (typically, in
  response to user requests, e.g. when a user force-closes a window containing one or more <span
  data-x="top-level browsing context">top-level browsing contexts</span>). Other <span
  data-x="browsing context">browsing contexts</span> must be discarded once their
  <code>WindowProxy</code> object is eligible for garbage collection, in addition to the other
  places where this specification requires them to be discarded.</p>

  <p>A <code>WindowProxy</code> does <em>not</em> have a strong reference to the <span>browsing
  context</span> it was created alongside. In particular, it is possible for a <span>nested
  browsing context</span> to be <span data-x="a browsing context is discarded">discarded</span> even
  if JavaScript code holds a reference to its <code>WindowProxy</code> object.</p>
