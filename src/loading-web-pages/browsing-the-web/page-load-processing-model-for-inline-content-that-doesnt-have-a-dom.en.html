  <p>When the user agent is to display a user agent page inline, provided a <span>browsing
  context</span> <var>browsingContext</var>, the user agent should:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>Let <var>navigationParams</var> be a new <span>navigation params</span> whose <span
    data-x="navigation-params-request">request</span> is null, <span
    data-x="navigation-params-response">response</span> is null, <span
    data-x="navigation-params-origin">origin</span> is a new <span
    data-x="concept-origin-opaque">opaque origin</span>, <span
    data-x="navigation-params-sandboxing">final sandboxing flag set</span> is an empty set, <span
    data-x="navigation-params-coop">cross-origin opener policy</span> is "<code
    data-x="coop-unsafe-none">unsafe-none</code>", <span
    data-x="navigation-params-reserved-environment">reserved environment</span> is null, <span
    data-x="navigation-params-browsing-context">browsing context</span> is
    <var>browsingContext</var>, and <span data-x="navigation-params-bc-switch-needed">browsing
    context switch needed</span> is false.</p>

    <p class="XXX">The algorithm called in the next step is not prepared to deal with a null <span
    data-x="navigation-params-response">response</span>. Probably we should synthesize one
    instead.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>Let <var>document</var> be the result of <span
   data-x="create-the-document-object">creating and initializing a <code>Document</code>
   object</span> given "<code data-x="">html</code>", "<code data-x="">text/html</code>", and
   <var>navigationParams</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Either associate <var>document</var> with a custom rendering that is not rendered using
   the normal <code>Document</code> rendering rules, or mutate <var>document</var> until it
   represents the content the user agent wants to render.</p>
  </ol>

  <!-- next two paragraphs are similar to the navigate-text section, keep them in sync -->

  <p>Once the page has been set up, the user agent must act as if it had <span data-x="stop
  parsing">stopped parsing</span>.</p>

  <p>Upon creation of the <code>Document</code> object, the user agent must run the <span
  data-x="concept-appcache-init">application cache selection algorithm</span> with no manifest,
  passing in the newly-created <code>Document</code>.</p>

  <p>After creating the <code>Document</code> object, but potentially before the page has been
  completely set up, the user agent must <span>update the session history with the new page</span>
  given <var>navigationParams</var>.</p>
