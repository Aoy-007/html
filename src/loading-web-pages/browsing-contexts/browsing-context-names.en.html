  <h4>Browsing context names</h4>

  <p>Browsing contexts can have a <dfn>browsing context name</dfn>. Unless stated otherwise, it is
  the empty string.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>valid browsing context name</dfn> is any string with at least one character that does
  not start with a U+005F LOW LINE character. (Names starting with an underscore are reserved for
  special keywords.)</p>

  <p>A <dfn>valid browsing context name or keyword</dfn> is any string that is either a <span>valid
  browsing context name</span> or that is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for one of:
  <code data-x="">_blank</code>, <code data-x="">_self</code>, <code data-x="">_parent</code>, or
  <code data-x="">_top</code>.</p>

  <p>These values have different meanings based on whether the page is sandboxed or not, as
  summarized in the following (non-normative) table. In this table, "current" means the
  <span>browsing context</span> that the link or script is in, "parent" means the <span>parent
  browsing context</span> of the one the link or script is in, "top" means the <span>top-level
  browsing context</span> of the one the link or script is in, "new" means a new <span>top-level
  browsing context</span> or <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> is to be created, subject to
  various user preferences and user agent policies, "none" means that nothing will happen, and
  "maybe new" means the same as "new" if the "<code
  data-x="attr-iframe-sandbox-allow-popups">allow-popups</code>" keyword is also specified on the
  <code data-x="attr-iframe-sandbox">sandbox</code> attribute (or if the user overrode the
  sandboxing), and the same as "none" otherwise.</p>

   <li><p>Let <var>windowType</var> be "<code data-x="">existing or none</code>".</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>name</var> is the empty string or an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for

   <li><p>Otherwise, if <var>name</var> is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for "<code

    are related enough that it is ok if they reach each other, set <var>chosen</var> to that
    browsing context. If there are multiple matching browsing contexts, the user agent should set
    <var>chosen</var> to one in some arbitrary consistent manner, such as the most recently opened,
    most recently focused, or more closely related.</p>
