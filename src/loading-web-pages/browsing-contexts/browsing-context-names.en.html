  <h4>Browsing context names</h4>

  <p>Browsing contexts can have a <dfn>browsing context name</dfn>. Unless stated otherwise, it is
  the empty string.</p>

  <p>A <dfn>valid browsing context name</dfn> is any string with at least one character that does
  not start with a U+005F LOW LINE character. (Names starting with an underscore are reserved for
  special keywords.)</p>

  <p>A <dfn>valid browsing context name or keyword</dfn> is any string that is either a <span>valid
  browsing context name</span> or that is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for one of:
  <code data-x="">_blank</code>, <code data-x="">_self</code>, <code data-x="">_parent</code>, or
  <code data-x="">_top</code>.</p>

  <p>These values have different meanings based on whether the page is sandboxed or not, as
  summarized in the following (non-normative) table. In this table, "current" means the
  <span>browsing context</span> that the link or script is in, "parent" means the <span>parent
  browsing context</span> of the one the link or script is in, "top" means the <span>top-level
  browsing context</span> of the one the link or script is in, "new" means a new <span>top-level
  browsing context</span> or <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> is to be created, subject to
  various user preferences and user agent policies, "none" means that nothing will happen, and
  "maybe new" means the same as "new" if the "<code
  data-x="attr-iframe-sandbox-allow-popups">allow-popups</code>" keyword is also specified on the
  <code data-x="attr-iframe-sandbox">sandbox</code> attribute (or if the user overrode the
  sandboxing), and the same as "none" otherwise.</p>

  <p class="tablenote"><small>Most of the restrictions on sandboxed browsing contexts are applied by

  <p><dfn id="the-rules-for-choosing-a-browsing-context-given-a-browsing-context-name">The rules for
  choosing a browsing context</dfn>, given a <span>browsing context name</span> <var>name</var>, a
  <span>browsing context</span> <var>current</var>, and a boolean <var>noopener</var> are as
  follows:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <var>chosen</var> be null.</p></li>

   <li><p>Let <var>new</var> be false.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>name</var> is the empty string or an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for
   "<code data-x="">_self</code>", then set <var>chosen</var> to <var>current</var>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>name</var> is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for "<code
   data-x="">_parent</code>", then set <var>chosen</var> to <var>current</var>'s <span>parent
   browsing context</span>, if any, and <var>current</var> otherwise.</p></li>

   <li><p>If <var>name</var> is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for "<code
   data-x="">_top</code>", then set <var>chosen</var> to <var>current</var>'s <span>top-level
   browsing context</span>, if any, and <var>current</var> otherwise.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>If <var>name</var> is not an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for "<code
    data-x="">_blank</code>" and there exists a browsing context whose <span data-x="browsing
    context name">name</span> is the same as <var>name</var>, and <var>current</var> is
    <span>familiar with</span> that browsing context, and the user agent determines that the two
    browsing contexts are related enough that it is ok if they reach each other, then set
    <var>chosen</var> to that browsing context. If there are multiple matching browsing contexts,
    the user agent should set <var>chosen</var> to one in some arbitrary consistent manner, such as
    the most recently opened, most recently focused, or more closely related.</p>

    <p class="&#x0058;&#x0058;&#x0058;">This will be made more precise in <a
    href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1440">issue #1440</a>.
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>Otherwise, a new browsing context is being requested, and what happens depends on the user
    agent's configuration and abilities &mdash; it is determined by the rules given for the first
    applicable option from the following list:</p>

    <dl class="switch">
     <dt id="popup-blocker">If the algorithm is not <span>triggered by user activation</span> and
     the user agent has been configured to not show popups (i.e. the user agent has a "popup
     blocker" enabled)</dt>

     <dd><p>The user agent may inform the user that a popup has been blocked.</p></dd>

     <dt id="sandboxWindowOpen">If <var>current</var>'s <span>active document</span>'s <span>active
     sandboxing flag set</span> has the <span>sandboxed auxiliary navigation browsing context
     flag</span> set.</dt>

     <dd>
      <p>The user agent may offer the user one of:

      <ol>
       <li><p>Set <var>chosen</var> to a <span data-x="creating a new browsing context">new</span>
       <span>top-level browsing context</span> given <var>noopener</var>, and set <var>new</var> to
       true.</p></li>

       <li><p>Set <var>chosen</var> to an existing <span>top-level browsing context</span>.</p>
      </ol>

      <p class="warning">If this case occurs, it means that an author has explicitly sandboxed the
      document that is trying to open a link.</p>

      <p class="note">If the user declines or the user agent doesn't offer the above, the variables
      remain unchanged.</p>
     </dd>

     <dt id="noopener">If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will
     create a new browsing context:</dt>

     <dd>
      <p>Set <var>chosen</var> to a <span data-x="creating a new browsing context">new</span>
      <span>auxiliary browsing context</span> given <var>noopener</var> with the <span>opener
      browsing context</span> being <var>current</var>, and set <var>new</var> to true. If
      <var>name</var> is not an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for "<code
      data-x="">_blank</code>", then <var>chosen</var>'s <span data-x="browsing context
      name">name</span> must be set to <var>name</var>.</p>

      <p class="note">If the newly created <span>browsing context</span> is immediately <span

     <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will reuse
     <var>current</var></dt>

     <dd><p>Set <var>chosen</var> to <var>current</var>.</p></dd>


     <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will not find a
     browsing context</dt>

     <dd><p>Do nothing.</p></dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">User agents are encouraged to provide a way for users to configure the user
    agent to always reuse <var>current</var>.</p>

    <p>If <var>new</var> is true, then:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>Let <var>flagSet</var> be <var>current</var>'s <span>active document</span>'s
     <span>active sandboxing flag set</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>flagSet</var>'s <span>sandboxed navigation browsing context flag</span> is set,
     then <var>current</var> must be set as <var>chosen</var>'s <span>one permitted sandboxed
     navigator</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>flagSet</var>'s <span>sandbox propagates to auxiliary browsing contexts
     flag</span> is set, then all the flags that are set in <var>flagSet</var> must be set in

    </ol>
   </li>

   <li><p>Return <var>chosen</var> and <var>new</var>.</p></li>
