  <h3 id="windows">Browsing contexts</h3>

  <p>A <dfn export>browsing context</dfn> is an environment in which <code>Document</code> objects
  are presented to the user.</p>

  <p class="note">A tab or window in a web browser typically contains a <span>browsing
  context</span>, as does an <code>iframe</code><span w-nodev> or <code>frame</code>s in a
  <code>frameset</code></span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> has a corresponding <code>WindowProxy</code> object.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> has an <dfn export>opener browsing context</dfn>, which is null
  or a <span>browsing context</span>. It is initially null.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> has a <dfn id="disowned-its-opener">disowned</dfn> boolean. It
  is initially false.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> has an <dfn>is closing</dfn> boolean. It is initially
  false.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>The following example illustrates the various possibilities of a <span>browsing context</span>.
   It can be <span>disowned</span>, <span>is closing</span>, neither, or both.</p>

   <pre><code class="js">// Neither disowned nor is closing:
const popup1 = window.open();

// Disowned, but not is closing:
const popup2 = window.open();
popup2.opener = null;

// Not disowned, but is closing:
const popup3 = window.open();
popup3.close();

// Disowned, is closing:
const popup4 = window.open();
popup4.opener = null;
popup4.close();</code></pre></div>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span> has a <span>session history</span>, which lists the
  <code>Document</code> objects that the <span>browsing context</span> has presented, is presenting,
  or will present. A <dfn data-x="concept-document-bc" data-lt="browsing context"
  for="Document" export><code>Document</code>'s browsing context</dfn> is the <span>browsing
  context</span> whose <span>session history</span> contains the <code>Document</code>, if any such
  browsing context exists and has not been <span data-x="a browsing context is
  discarded">discarded</span>, and null otherwise.</p>

  <p class="note">A <code>Document</code> does not necessarily have a non-null <span
  data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span>. In particular, data mining tools are likely
  to never instantiate browsing contexts. A <code>Document</code> created using an API such as <code
  data-x="dom-DOMImplementation-createDocument">createDocument()</code> never has a non-null <span
  data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span>. And the <code>Document</code> originally
  created for an <code>iframe</code> element, which has since been <span data-x="node is removed
  from a document">removed from the document</span>, has no associated browsing context, since that
  browsing context was <span data-x="a browsing context is discarded">discarded</span>.</p>

  <p>A <span>browsing context</span>'s <dfn export for="browsing context">active window</dfn> is its
  <code>WindowProxy</code> object's <span data-x="concept-windowproxy-window">[[Window]]</span>
  internal slot value. A <span>browsing context</span>'s <dfn export>active document</dfn> is its
  <span>active window</span>'s <span data-x="concept-document-window">associated
  <code>Document</code></span>.

  <p class="note">In general, there is a 1-to-1 mapping from the <code>Window</code> object to the
  <code>Document</code> object, as long as the <code>Document</code> object has a non-null <span
  data-x="concept-document-bc">browsing context</span>. There is one exception. A
  <code>Window</code> can be reused for the presentation of a second <code>Document</code> in the
  same <span>browsing context</span>, such that the mapping is then 1-to-2. This occurs when a
  <span>browsing context</span> is <span data-x="navigate">navigated</span> from the initial
  <code>about:blank</code> <code>Document</code> to another, with <var
  data-x="navigation-hh">historyHandling</var> set to "<code
  data-x="hh-replace">replace</code>".</p>
