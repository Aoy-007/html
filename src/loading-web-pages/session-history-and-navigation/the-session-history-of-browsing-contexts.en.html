  <h4>The session history of browsing contexts</h4>

  <p>The sequence of <code>Document</code>s in a <span>browsing context</span> is its <dfn>session
  history</dfn>. Each <span>browsing context</span>, including <span data-x="child browsing
  context">child browsing contexts</span>, has a distinct session history. A <span>browsing
  context</span>'s session history consists of a flat list of <span data-x="session history
  entry">session history entries</span>.</p>

  <p>Each <code>Document</code> object in a <span>browsing context</span>'s <span>session
  history</span> is associated with a unique <code>History</code> object which must all model the
  same underlying <span>session history</span>.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>The <dfn attribute for="Window"><code data-x="dom-history">history</code></dfn> getter steps
  are to return <span>this</span>'s <span data-x="concept-document-window">associated
  <code>Document</code></span>'s <code>History</code> instance.</p>

  </div>

  <p>A <dfn>session history entry</dfn> is a <span>struct</span> with the following <span
  data-x="struct item">items</span>:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p><dfn data-x="she-url">URL</dfn>, a <span>URL</span></p></li>

   <li>
    <p><dfn data-x="she-document">document</dfn>, a <code>Document</code> or null</p>

    <p class="note">Each entry, when first created, has a <code>Document</code> for its <span
    data-x="she-document">document</span>. However, when a <code>Document</code> is not <span
    data-x="fully active">active</span>, it's possible for it to be <span data-x="discard a
    Document">discarded</span> to free resources. The <span data-x="she-url">URL</span> and other
    data in the <span>session history entry</span> is then used to bring a new <code>Document</code>
    into being to take the place of the original, in the case where the user agent finds itself
    having to navigate to the entry.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p><dfn data-x="she-serialized-state">serialized state</dfn>, which is <span>serialized
   state</span> or null, initially null</p></li>

   <li>
    <p><dfn data-x="she-title">title</dfn>, a <span>string</span> or null</p>

    <p class="note">This need not have any relation with the current <code>title</code> of the <span
    data-x="she-document">document</span>. The <span>session history entry</span> <span
    data-x="she-title">title</span> is intended to explain the state of the document at that point,
    so that the user can navigate the document's history.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p><dfn data-x="she-scroll-restoration-mode">scroll restoration mode</dfn>, a <span>scroll
   restoration mode</span>, initially "<code
   data-x="dom-ScrollRestoration-auto">auto</code>".</p></li>

   <li><p><dfn data-x="she-scroll-position">scroll position data</dfn>, which is scroll position
   data for the <span data-x="she-document">document</span>'s <span>restorable scrollable
   regions</span>.</li>

   <li><p><dfn data-x="she-bc-name">browsing context name</dfn>, a <span>browsing context
   name</span></p></li>

   <li>
    <p id="an-entry-with-persisted-user-state"><dfn data-x="she-other">persisted user state</dfn>,
    which is <span>implementation-defined</span>, initially null</p>

    <p class="example">For example, some user agents might want to persist the values of form
    controls.</p>

    <p class="note">User agents that persist the value of form controls are encouraged to also
    persist their directionality (the value of the element's <code data-x="attr-dir">dir</code>
    attribute). This prevents values from being displayed incorrectly after a history traversal when
    the user had originally entered the values with an explicit, non-default directionality.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p id="state-object"><dfn>Serialized state</dfn> is a serialization (via
  <span>StructuredSerializeForStorage</span>) of an object representing a user interface state. We
  sometimes informally refer to "state objects", which are the objects representing user interface
  state supplied by the author, or alternately the objects created by deserializing (via
  <span>StructuredDeserialize</span>) serialized state.</p>

  <p>Pages can <span data-x="dom-history-pushState">add</span> <span>serialized state</span> to the
  session history. These are then <span data-x="StructuredDeserialize">deserialized</span> and <span
  data-x="event-popstate">returned to the script</span> when the user (or script) goes back in the
  history, thus enabling authors to use the "navigation" metaphor even in one-page applications.</p>

  <div class="note">
   <p><span>Serialized state</span> is intended to be used for two main purposes: first, storing a
   preparsed description of the state in the <span>URL</span> so that in the simple case an author
   doesn't have to do the parsing (though one would still need the parsing for handling <span
   data-x="URL">URLs</span> passed around by users, so it's only a minor optimization). Second, so
   that the author can store state that one wouldn't store in the URL because it only applies to the
   current <code>Document</code> instance and it would have to be reconstructed if a new
   <code>Document</code> were opened.</p>

   <p>An example of the latter would be something like keeping track of the precise coordinate from
   which a popup <code>div</code> was made to animate, so that if the user goes back, it can be made
   to animate to the same location. Or alternatively, it could be used to keep a pointer into a
   cache of data that would be fetched from the server based on the information in the
   <span>URL</span>, so that when going back and forward, the information doesn't have to be fetched
   again.</p>
  </div>

  <p>A <dfn>scroll restoration mode</dfn> indicates whether the user agent should restore the
  persisted scroll position (if any) when traversing to an <span data-x="session history
  entry">entry</span>. A scroll restoration mode is one of the following:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>"<dfn><code subdfn data-x="dom-ScrollRestoration-auto">auto</code></dfn>"</dt>
   <dd>The user agent is responsible for restoring the scroll position upon navigation.</dd>
   <dt>"<dfn><code subdfn data-x="dom-ScrollRestoration-manual">manual</code></dfn>"</dt>
   <dd>The page is responsible for restoring the scroll position and the user agent does not
   attempt to do so automatically</dd>
  </dl>

  <hr>

  <p>Several contiguous entries in a session history can share the same <span
  data-x="she-document">document</span>. This can occur when the initial entry is reached via normal
  <span data-x="navigate">navigation</span>, and the following entry is added via <code
  data-x="dom-history-pushState">history.pushState()</code>. Or it can occur via <span
  data-x="navigate-fragid">navigation to a fragment</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">All entries that share the same <span data-x="she-document">document</span> (and
  that are therefore merely different states of one particular document) are contiguous by
  definition.</p>

  <div w-nodev>

  <p>User agents may <span data-x="discard a Document">discard</span> the <span
  data-x="she-document">documents</span> of entries with non-null <span
  data-x="she-document">documents</span>, as long as the following conditions are met:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>They must not discard the <span data-x="she-document">document</span> of the <span>current
   entry</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>They must not discard any <code>Document</code> objects which are referenced from
   script.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Apart from these restrictions, this standard does not specify when user agents should discard
  an entry's <span data-x="she-document">document</span>, versus keeping it cached.</p>

  <p class="note"><span data-x="discard a Document">Discarding</span> a <code>Document</code> will
  set the corresponding <span data-x="she-document">document</span> item of any <span
  data-x="session history entry">session history entries</span> to null. Subsequent navigations to
  those entries will result in the creation of a new <code>Document</code> object, and set the <span
  data-x="she-document">document</span> item to it.</p>

  </div>

  <hr>

  <p>At any point, one of the entries in the session history is the <dfn>current entry</dfn>. This
  is the entry representing the <span>active document</span> of the <span>browsing context</span>.
  Which entry is the <span>current entry</span> is changed by the algorithms defined in this
  specification, e.g., during <span data-x="traverse the history">session history
  traversal</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">The <span>current entry</span> is usually the initial entry created upon
  navigation. However, it can also be one of the contiguous entries that share the same <span
  data-x="she-document">document</span>, as described above.</p>

  <p>Each <code>Document</code> in a <span>browsing context</span> can also have a <dfn>latest
  entry</dfn>. This is the entry for that <code>Document</code> to which the <span>browsing
  context</span>'s <span>session history</span> was most recently traversed. When a
  <code>Document</code> is created, it initially has no <span>latest entry</span>.</p>
