  <h4>Origin isolation</h4>

  <dl class="domintro">
   <dt>window . <code subdfn data-x="dom-originIsolated">originIsolated</code></dt>

   <dd>
    <p>Returns true if this <code>Window</code> is origin-isolated in the manner described in this
    section.</p>
   </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>A <code>Document</code> delivered over a <span>secure context</span> can opt in to origin
  isolation, by using the `<code data-x="http-origin-isolation">Origin-Isolation</code>` HTTP
  response header. This header is a <span data-x="http-structured-header">structured header</span>
  whose value must be a <span data-x="http-structured-header-boolean">boolean</span>. <ref
  spec=STRUCTURED-FIELDS></p>

  <p><span w-nodev>Per the processing model in the <span data-x="create-the-document-object">create
  and initialize a new <code>Document</code> object</span>, values</span><span
  w-nohtml>Values</span> that are not the <span data-x="http-structured-header-boolean">structured
  header boolean</span> true value (i.e., `<code data-x="">?1</code>`) will be ignored.</p>

  <p>The consequences of using this header are that <span w-nodev>the resulting
  <code>Document</code>'s <span>agent cluster key</span> is its <span>origin</span>, instead of the
  <span data-x="obtain a site">corresponding site</span>. In terms of observable effects, this means
  that </span>attempting to <a href="#relaxing-the-same-origin-restriction">relax the same-origin
  restriction</a> using <code data-x="dom-document-domain">document.domain</code> will instead do
  nothing, and it will not be possible to send <code>WebAssembly.Module</code> objects to
  cross-origin <code>Document</code>s (even if they are <span>same site</span>). Behind the scenes,
  this isolation can allow user agents to allocate implementation-specific resources corresponding
  to <span data-x="agent cluster">agent clusters</span>, such as processes or threads, more
  efficiently.</p>

  <p>Note that within a <span>browsing context group</span>, the `<code
  data-x="http-origin-isolation">Origin-Isolation</code>` header can never cause same-origin
  <code>Document</code> objects to end up in different <span data-x="agent cluster">agent
  clusters</span>, even if one sends the header and the other doesn't.<span w-nodev> This is
  prevented by means of the <span>historical agent cluster key map</span>.</span></p>

  <p class="note">This means that the <code data-x="dom-originIsolated">originIsolated</code> getter
  can return false, even if the header is set, if the header was omitted on a previously-loaded
  same-origin page in the same <span>browsing context group</span>. Similarly, it can return true
  even when the header is not set.</p>

  <p w-nodev>The <dfn><code data-x="dom-originIsolated">originIsolated</code></dfn> getter steps are
  to return the <span>surrounding agent</span>'s <span>agent cluster</span>'s
  <span>origin-isolated</span>.</p>

  <p class="note"><code>Document</code>s with an <span data-x="concept-origin-opaque">opaque
  origin</span> can be considered unconditionally origin-isolated; for them the header has no
  effect.</p>

  <p class="note">Similarly, <code>Document</code>s in a <span>cross-origin isolated</span>
  <span>agent cluster</span> are automatically origin-isolated. The `<code
  data-x="http-origin-isolation">Origin-Isolation</code>` header might be useful as an additional
  hint to implementations about resource allocation, since the `<code
  data-x="http-cross-origin-opener-policy">Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy</code>` and
  `<code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy</code>` headers used to achieve cross-origin isolation are
  more about ensuring that everything in the same address space opts in to being there. But adding
  it would have no additional observable effects on author code.</p>
