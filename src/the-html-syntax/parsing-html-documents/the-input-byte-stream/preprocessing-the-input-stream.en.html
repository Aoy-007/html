  <h5>Preprocessing the input stream</h5>

  <p>The <dfn>input stream</dfn> consists of the characters pushed into it as the <span>input byte
  stream</span> is decoded or from the various APIs that directly manipulate the input stream.</p>

  <p>Any occurrences of <span data-x="surrogate">surrogates</span>, <span
  data-x="noncharacter">noncharacters</span>, or <span data-x="control">controls</span> other than
  <span>ASCII whitespace</span> are <span data-x="parse error">parse errors</span>.</p>

  <p class="note">Isolated surrogates can only find their way into the input stream via script APIs
  such as <code data-x="dom-document-write">document.write()</code>.</p>

  <p>U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters and U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters are treated
  specially. Any LF character that immediately follows a CR character must be ignored, and all CR
  characters must then be converted to LF characters. Thus, newlines in HTML DOMs are represented by
  LF characters, and there are never any CR characters in the input to the <span>tokenization</span>
  stage.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>next input character</dfn> is the first character in the <span>input stream</span>
  that has not yet been <dfn data-x="">consumed</dfn> or explicitly ignored by the requirements in
  this section. Initially, the <i data-x="next input character">next input character</i> is the
  first character in the input. The <dfn>current input character</dfn> is the last character to have
  been <i>consumed</i>.</p>

  <p>The <dfn>insertion point</dfn> is the position (just before a character or just before the end
  of the input stream) where content inserted using <code
  data-x="dom-document-write">document.write()</code> is actually inserted. The insertion point is
  relative to the position of the character immediately after it, it is not an absolute offset into
  the input stream. Initially, the insertion point is undefined.</p>

  <p>The "EOF" character in the tables below is a conceptual character representing the end of the
  <span>input stream</span>. If the parser is a <span>script-created parser</span>, then the end of
  the <span>input stream</span> is reached when an <dfn>explicit "EOF" character</dfn> (inserted by
  the <code data-x="dom-document-close">document.close()</code> method) is consumed. Otherwise, the
  "EOF" character is not a real character in the stream, but rather the lack of any further
  characters.</p>

  <p class="note">The handling of U+0000 NULL characters varies based on where the characters are
  found. In general, they are ignored except where doing so could plausibly introduce an attack
  vector. This handling is, by necessity, spread across both the tokenization stage and the tree
  construction stage.</p>
