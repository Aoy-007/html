  <div class="example">

    <p>If the markup contains (not in an attribute) the string <code data-x="">I'm &amp;notit; I
    tell you</code>, the character reference is parsed as "not", as in, <code data-x="">I'm &not;it;
    I tell you</code> (and this is a parse error). But if the markup was <code data-x="">I'm
    &amp;notin; I tell you</code>, the character reference would be parsed as "notin;", resulting
    in <code data-x="">I'm &notin; I tell you</code> (and no parse error).</p>

    <p>However, if the markup contains the string <code data-x="">I'm &amp;notit; I tell you</code>
    in an attribute, no character reference is parsed and string remains intact (and there is no
    parse error).</p>
