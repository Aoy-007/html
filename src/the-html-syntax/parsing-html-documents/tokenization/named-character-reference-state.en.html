  <h5><dfn>Named character reference state</dfn></h5>

  <p>Consume the maximum number of characters possible, with the consumed characters matching one
  of the identifiers in the first column of the <span>named character references</span> table (in
  a <span>case-sensitive</span> manner). Append each character to the <var data-x="temporary
  buffer">temporary buffer</var> when it's consumed.</p>

  <dl class="switch">

   <dt>If there is a match</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>If the character reference was consumed as part of an attribute (<var data-x="return
    state">return state</var> is either <span>attribute value (double-quoted) state</span>,
    <span>attribute value (single-quoted) state</span> or <span>attribute value (unquoted)
    state</span>), and the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), and the
    <span>next input character</span> is either a U+003D EQUALS SIGN character (=) or an
    <span>ASCII alphanumeric</span>, then, for historical reasons, switch to the <span>character
    reference end state</span>.</p>
    <!-- "=" added because of https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=9207#c5 -->

    <p>Otherwise:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>If the last character matched is not a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), then this is a
     <span>parse error</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Set the <var data-x="temporary buffer">temporary buffer</var> to the empty string.
     Append one or two characters corresponding to the character reference name (as given by the

  <div class="example">

    <p>If the markup contains (not in an attribute) the string <code data-x="">I'm &amp;notit; I
    tell you</code>, the character reference is parsed as "not", as in, <code data-x="">I'm &not;it;
    I tell you</code> (and this is a parse error). But if the markup was <code data-x="">I'm
    &amp;notin; I tell you</code>, the character reference would be parsed as "notin;", resulting
    in <code data-x="">I'm &notin; I tell you</code> (and no parse error).</p>

    <p>However, if the markup contains the string <code data-x="">I'm &amp;notit; I tell you</code>
    in an attribute, no character reference is parsed and string remains intact (and there is no
    parse error).</p>
