  <h3 split-filename="named-characters"><dfn>Named character references</dfn></h3>

  <p>This table lists the character reference names that are supported by HTML, and the code points
  to which they refer. It is referenced by the previous sections.</p>

  <p class="note">It is intentional, for legacy compatibility, that many code points have multiple
  character reference names. For example, some appear both with and without the trailing semicolon,
  or with different capitalizations.</p>

   If we want to add character references, Almorca suggests:
   > I would add &sub1; (character U+2081), &sub2; (character U+2082) and &sub3; (character U+2083).
   > They would are the equivalent to &sup1;, &sup2;, and &sup3;.

  <p>This data is also available <a href="/entities.json">as a JSON file</a>.</p>

  <p><i>The glyphs displayed above are non-normative. Refer to Unicode for formal definitions of the
  characters listed above.</i></p>

  <p class="note">The character reference names originate from <cite>XML Entity Definitions for
  Characters</cite>, though only the above is considered normative. <ref
