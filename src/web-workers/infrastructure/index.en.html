  <h3>Infrastructure</h3>

  <p>This standard defines two kinds of workers: dedicated workers, and shared workers. Dedicated
  workers, once created, are linked to their creator, but message ports can be used to communicate
  from a dedicated worker to multiple other browsing contexts or workers. Shared workers, on the
  other hand, are named, and once created any script running in the same <span>origin</span> can
  obtain a reference to that worker and communicate with it. <cite>Service Workers</cite> defines a
  third kind. <ref spec="SW"></p>
