  <h4 id="worker-event-loop">The event loop</h4>

  <p>A <span>worker event loop</span>'s <span data-x="task queue">task queues</span> only have
  events, callbacks, and networking activity as <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span>.<span
  w-nodev> These <span data-x="worker event loop">worker event loops</span> are created by the
  <span>run a worker</span> algorithm.</span></p>

  <p>Each <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object has a <dfn data-x="dom-WorkerGlobalScope-closing"
  export for="WorkerGlobalScope">closing</dfn> flag, <span w-nodev>which must be</span> initially
  false, but which can get set to true <span w-nodev>by the algorithms in the processing model
  section below</span><span w-dev>when the worker is requested to close</span>.</p>

  <p>Once the <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code>'s <span
  data-x="dom-WorkerGlobalScope-closing">closing</span> flag is set to true, the <span>event
  loop</span>'s <span data-x="task queue">task queues</span> <span w-nodev>must</span> discard any
  further <span data-x="concept-task">tasks</span> that would be added to them (tasks already on the
  queue are unaffected except where otherwise specified). Effectively, once the <span
  data-x="dom-WorkerGlobalScope-closing">closing</span> flag is true, timers stop firing,
  notifications for all pending background operations are dropped, etc.</p>
