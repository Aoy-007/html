  <h4>The worker's lifetime</h4>

  <p>Workers communicate with other workers and with <span data-x="browsing context">browsing
  contexts</span> through <span data-x="channel messaging">message channels</span> and their
  <code>MessagePort</code> objects.</p>

  <p>Each <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object <var>worker global scope</var> has a list of
  <dfn data-export="">the worker's ports</dfn>, which consists of all the <code>MessagePort</code>
  objects that are entangled with another port and that have one (but only one) port owned by
  <var>worker global scope</var>. This list includes the implicit <code>MessagePort</code> in the
  case of <span data-x="DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope">dedicated workers</span>.</p>

  <p>Whenever a <code>Document</code> object is <span data-x="discard a Document">discarded</span>,
  it must be <span data-x="list remove">removed</span> from the <span>owner set</span> of each
  <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object whose set <span data-x="list contains">contains</span> that
  <code>Document</code> object.</p>

  <p id="list-of-relevant-document-objects-to-add">Given an <span>environment settings object</span>
  <var>o</var> when creating or obtaining a worker, the <dfn>relevant owner to add</dfn> depends on
  the type of <span data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global object</span> specified by
  <var>o</var>. If <var>o</var> specifies a <span data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global
  object</span> that is a <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object (i.e., if we are creating a nested
  worker), then the relevant owner is that global object. Otherwise, <var>o</var> specifies a <span
  data-x="concept-settings-object-global">global object</span> that is a <code>Window</code> object,
  and the relevant owner is the <span>responsible document</span> specified by <var>o</var>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>A worker is said to be a <dfn>permissible worker</dfn> if its <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code>'s
  <span>owner set</span> is not <span data-x="list is empty">empty</span> or:</p>

  <ul class=brief>
   <li>its <span>owner set</span> has been <span data-x="list is empty">empty</span> for no more
   than a short user-agent-defined timeout value,</li>
   <li>its <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object is a <code>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</code> object
   (i.e., the worker is a shared worker), and</li>
   <li>the user agent has a <span>browsing context</span> whose <code>Document</code> object is not
   <span>completely loaded</span>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">The second part of this definition allows a shared worker to survive for a short
  time while a page is loading, in case that page is going to contact the shared worker again. This
  can be used by user agents as a way to avoid the cost of restarting a shared worker used by a site
  when the user is navigating from page to page within that site.</p>

  <p>A worker is said to be an <dfn>active needed worker</dfn> if any its <span data-x="owner
  set">owners</span> are either <code>Document</code> objects that are <span>fully active</span> or
  <span data-x="active needed worker">active needed workers</span>.</p>

  <p>A worker is said to be a <dfn>protected worker</dfn> if it is an <span>active needed
  worker</span> and either it has outstanding timers, database transactions, or network connections,
  or its list of <span>the worker's ports</span> is not empty, or its <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code>
  is actually a <code>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</code> object (i.e. the worker is a shared
  worker).</p>

  <p>A worker is said to be a <dfn>suspendable worker</dfn> if it is not an <span>active needed
  worker</span> but it is a <span>permissible worker</span>.</p>
