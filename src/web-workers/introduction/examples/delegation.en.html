  <p>With multicore CPUs becoming prevalent, one way to obtain better performance is to split
  computationally expensive tasks amongst multiple workers. In this example, a computationally
  expensive task that is to be performed for every number from 1 to 10,000,000 is farmed out to ten
  subworkers.</p>

  <p>The main page is as follows, it just reports the result:</p>

  <pre><code class="html" data-x="">EXAMPLE workers/multicore/page.html</code></pre>

  <p>The worker itself is as follows:</p>

  <pre><code class="js" data-x="">EXAMPLE workers/multicore/worker.js</code></pre>

  <p>It consists of a loop to start the subworkers, and then a handler
  that waits for all the subworkers to respond.</p>

  <p>The subworkers are implemented as follows:</p>

  <pre><code class="js" data-x="">EXAMPLE workers/multicore/core.js</code></pre>

  <p>They receive two numbers in two events, perform the computation for the range of numbers thus
  specified, and then report the result back to the parent.</p>
