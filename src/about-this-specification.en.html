  <h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="about-dev-edition">About this specification</h2>

  <p>This specification is like no other â€” it has been processed with <em>you</em>, the humble web
  developer, in mind.</p>

  <p>The focus of this specification is readability and ease of access. Unlike the <a
  href="/multipage/">full HTML Standard</a>, this "developer's edition" removes information that
  only browser vendors need know. It is automatically produced from the full specification by our
  build tooling, and thus always in sync with the latest developments in HTML.</p>

  <p>To read about its conception, construction, and future, read the <a
  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150220020906/http://archive.germanforblack.com:80/articles/html5-for-web-developers">original
  press release</a>, and the <a href="https://blog.whatwg.org/developers-edition-comeback">blog post
  about its relaunch</a>.</p>

  <p>Finally, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/labels/dev%20edition">contribute
  on GitHub</a> to make this edition better for everyone!</p>
